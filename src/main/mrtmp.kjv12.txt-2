        son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
        son of Jesse;

011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
        bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
        his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
        threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
        threescore daughters.)

011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
        ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
        throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
        fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
        desired many wives.

012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
        kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
        the LORD, and all Israel with him.

012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
        had transgressed against the LORD,

012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
        horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
        him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
        Ethiopians.

012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
        came to Jerusalem.

012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
        of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
        Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
        forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
        Shishak.

012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
        themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
        of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
        themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
        grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
        out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
        service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
        away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
        of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
        shields of gold which Solomon had made.

012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
        committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
        kept the entrance of the king's house.

012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
        guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
        guard chamber.

012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
        him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
        Judah things went well.

012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
        reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
        began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
        the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
        Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
        Naamah an Ammonitess.

012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
        LORD.

012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
        in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
        concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
        and Jeroboam continually.

012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
        reign over Judah.

013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
        war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
        of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
        set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
        thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
        Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
        kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
        sons by a covenant of salt?

013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
        of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
        Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
        son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
        could not withstand them.

013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
        hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
        there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
        gods.

013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
        Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
        manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
        to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
        same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
        him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
        sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
        burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
        they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
        with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
        charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
        priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
        children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
        fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
        so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
        behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
        with the trumpets.

013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
        shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
        Israel before Abijah and Judah.

013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
        delivered them into their hand.

013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
        there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
        men.

013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
        and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
        the LORD God of their fathers.

013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
        Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
        thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
        Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
        twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
        sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
        days the land was quiet ten years.

014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
        LORD his God:

014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
        places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
        to do the law and the commandment.

014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
        places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
        and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
        him rest.

014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
        make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
        land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
        God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
        side. So they built and prospered.

014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
        of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
        bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
        thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
        host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
        came unto Mareshah.

014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
        array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
        nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
        that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
        thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
        thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
        and the Ethiopians fled.

014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
        Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
        recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
        and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
        of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
        for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
        and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
        Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
        ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
        but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
        and without a teaching priest, and without law.

015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
        Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
        nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
        inhabitants of the countries.

015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
        did vex them with all adversity.

015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
        your work shall be rewarded.

015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
        prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
        out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
        cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
        altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
        them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
        fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
        LORD his God was with him.

015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
        month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
        which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
        sheep.

015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
        fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
        put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
        shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
        all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
        he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
        removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
        a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
        it at the brook Kidron.

015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
        nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
        father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
        the reign of Asa.

016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
        of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
        intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
        Judah.

016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
        the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
        Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
        father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
        gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
        may depart from me.

016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
        building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
        stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
        building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
        and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
        Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
        host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
        many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
        the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
        earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
        heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
        therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
        house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
        And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
        written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
        in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
        disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
        fortieth year of his reign.

016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
        for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
        which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
        prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
        burning for him.

017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
        himself against Israel.

017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
        set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
        Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
        first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
        commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
        Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
        honour in abundance.

017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
        he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
        even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
        Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
        and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
        Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
        Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
        LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
        Judah, and taught the people.

017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
        lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
        against Jehoshaphat.

017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
        tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
        thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
        hundred he goats.

017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
        castles, and cities of store.

017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
        of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
        their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
        chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
        thousand.

017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
        hundred and fourscore thousand.

017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
        offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
        thousand mighty men of valour.

017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
        armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
        fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
        the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
        affinity with Ahab.

018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
        Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
        people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
        him to Ramothgilead.

018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
        am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
        with thee in the war.

018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
        he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
        Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
        king say so.

018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
        said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
        either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
        sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets prophesied before them.

018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
        and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
        Syria until they be consumed.

018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the hand of the king.

018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
        saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
        king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
        like one of their's, and speak thou good.

018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
        that will I speak.

018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
        Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
        forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
        delivered into your hand.

018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
        LORD?

018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
        mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
        These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
        his house in peace.

018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
        LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing on his right hand and on his left.

018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
        he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
        after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
        Wherewith?

018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
        of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
        and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        against thee.

018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
        Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
        the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
        shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
        back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I return in peace.

018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
        not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
        people.

018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
        robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
        to the battle.

018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
        chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
        or great, save only with the king of Israel.

018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
        Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
        cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
        depart from him.

018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
        again from pursuing him.

018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
        to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
        stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
        even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
        peace to Jerusalem.

019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
        said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
        love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
        from before the LORD.

019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
        hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
        thine heart to seek God.

019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
        through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
        brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
        of Judah, city by city,

019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
        for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
        and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
        respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
        of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
        the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
        returned to Jerusalem.

019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
        the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
        dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
        commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
        that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
        upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
        trespass.

019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
        matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
        ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
        the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
        and the LORD shall be with the good.

020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
        and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
        Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
        cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
        this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
        is Engedi.

020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
        proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
        LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
        the LORD.

020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
        Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
        heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
        heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
        that none is able to withstand thee?

020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
        this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
        of Abraham thy friend for ever?

020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
        therein for thy name, saying,

020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
        pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
        presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
        in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
        Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
        out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
        destroyed them not;

020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
        thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
        against this great company that cometh against us; neither
        know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
        their wives, and their children.

020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
        the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
        of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
        congregation;

020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
        Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
        you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
        multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
        cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
        before the wilderness of Jeruel.

020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
        stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
        Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
        out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
        and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
        LORD, worshipping the LORD.

020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
        children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
        Israel with a loud voice on high.

020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
        wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
        and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
        believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
        singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
        holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
        the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
        ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
        Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
        inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
        and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
        every one helped to destroy another.

020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
        they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
        bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
        spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
        with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
        off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
        were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
        of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
        name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
        unto this day.

020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
        Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
        with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
        enemies.

020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
        trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
        countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
        the enemies of Israel.

020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
        rest round about.

020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
        years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
        five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
        daughter of Shilhi.

020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
        from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
        people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
        fathers.

020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
        Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
        Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
        Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
        Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
        Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
        broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
        in his stead.

021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
        Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
        Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
        Israel.

021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
        and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
        kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
        strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
        sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
        the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
        and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
        of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
        promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
        Judah, and made themselves a king.

021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
        with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
        which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
        this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
        hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
        caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
        compelled Judah thereto.

021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
        thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
        nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
        made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
        like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
        slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
        than thyself:

021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
        and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
        until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
        day.

021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
        Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
        Ethiopians:

021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
        away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
        his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
        left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
        incurable disease.

021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
        two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
        he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
        him, like the burning of his fathers.

021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
        desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
        in the sepulchres of the kings.

022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
        king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
        Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
        son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
        mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
        of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
        father to his destruction.

022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
        son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
        at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
        which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
        of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
        down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
        sick.

022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
        for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
        the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
        house of Ahab.

022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
        upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
        the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
        Ahaziah, he slew them.

022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
        Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
        him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
        Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
        house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
        of Judah.

022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
        of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
        slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
        Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
        Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
        him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
        Athaliah reigned over the land.

023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
        took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
        Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
        Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
        into covenant with him.

023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
        all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
        Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
        house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
        shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
        entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
        shall be porters of the doors;

023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
        part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
        be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
        priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
        in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
        of the LORD.

023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
        with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
        the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
        when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
        Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
        that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
        out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
        courses.

023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
        hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
        David's, which were in the house of God.

023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
        hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
        the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
        round about.

023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
        crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
        Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
        king.

023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
        praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
        the LORD:

023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
        the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
        and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
        trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
        such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
        and said, Treason, Treason.

023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
        that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
        forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
        with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
        of the LORD.

023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
        entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
        there.

023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
        people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
        people.

023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
        down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
        Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
        by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
        distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
        offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
        that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
        governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
        brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
        came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
        king upon the throne of the kingdom.

023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
        quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
        daughters.

024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
        repair the house of the LORD.

024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
        to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
        Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
        year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
        hastened it not.

024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
        Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
        Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
        commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
        congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
        house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
        of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
        without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
        bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
        God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
        in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
        unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
        they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
        high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
        and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
        and gathered money in abundance.

024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
        the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
        carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
        wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
        and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
        it.

024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
        money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
        for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
        offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
        they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
        continually all the days of Jehoiada.

024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
        hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
        because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
        toward his house.

024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
        made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
        served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
        Jerusalem for this their trespass.

024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
        LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
        ear.

024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
        the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
        Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
        LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
        LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
        the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
        LORD.

024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
        his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
        died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
        Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
        Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
        among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
        of Damascus.

024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
        and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
        they executed judgment against Joash.

024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
        great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
        the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
        his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
        David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
        of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
        Moabitess.

024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
        upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
        are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
        his son reigned in his stead.

025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
        not with a perfect heart.

025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
        that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
        the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
        saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
        shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
        die for his own sin.

025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
        to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
        Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
        above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
        to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
        Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
        the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
        Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
        shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
        help, and to cast down.

025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
        the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
        And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
        much more than this.

025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
        him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
        was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
        great anger.

025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
        and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
        Seir ten thousand.

025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
        carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
        and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
        were broken in pieces.

025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
        they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
        Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
        thousand of them, and took much spoil.

025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
        slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
        children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
        down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
        and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
        thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
        deliver their own people out of thine hand?

025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
        unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
        shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
        I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
        hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
        son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
        Come, let us see one another in the face.

025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
        heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
        shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
        even thou, and Judah with thee?

025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
        sought after the gods of Edom.

025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
        in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
        Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
        every man to his tent.

025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
        son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
        him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
        the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
        that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
        treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
        to Samaria.

025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
        are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel?

025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
        the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
        he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
        slew him there.

025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
        fathers in the city of Judah.

026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
        years old, and made him king in the room of his father
        Amaziah.

026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah did.

026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
        understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
        the LORD, God made him to prosper.

026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
        brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
        wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
        Philistines.

026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
        Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
        abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
        himself exceedingly.

026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
        and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
        fortified them.

026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
        he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
        plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
        and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
        war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
        hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
        hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
        of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
        seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
        power, to help the king against the enemy.

026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
        and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
        to cast stones.

026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
        be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
        great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
        was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
        destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
        went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
        altar of incense.

026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
        fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
        appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
        LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
        consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
        hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
        LORD God.

026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
        incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
        even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
        of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
        him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
        thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
        out, because the LORD had smitten him.

026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
        dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
        from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
        king's house, judging the people of the land.

026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
        the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
        fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
        kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
        reigned in his stead.

027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
        entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
        yet corruptly.

027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
        wall of Ophel he built much.

027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
        forests he built castles and towers.

027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
        against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
        an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
        wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
        Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
        the LORD his God.

027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
        ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
        and Judah.

027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
        was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
        also molten images for Baalim.

028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
        and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
        the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
        Israel.

028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
        on the hills, and under every green tree.

028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
        king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
        multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
        he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
        smote him with a great slaughter.

028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
        twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
        son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
        was next to the king.

028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
        brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
        took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
        Samaria.

028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
        he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
        unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
        wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
        ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
        Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
        not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
        ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
        of the LORD is upon you.

028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
        the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
        Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
        stood up against them that came from the war,

028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
        for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
        intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
        trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
        princes and all the congregation.

028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
        captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
        them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
        and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
        them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
        trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
        help him.

028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
        away captives.

028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
        country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
        and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
        thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
        the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
        for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
        LORD.

028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
        distressed him, but strengthened him not.

028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
        out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
        unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
        against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
        and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
        therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
        they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
        and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
        every corner of Jerusalem.

028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
        incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
        his fathers.

028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
        sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
        and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father had done.

029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
        them together into the east street,

029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
        yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
        fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
        in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
        have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
        and turned their backs.

029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
        lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
        in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
        and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
        hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
        and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
        of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
        stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
        unto him, and burn incense.

029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
        son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
        of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
        Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
        Eden the son of Joah:

029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
        sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
        of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
        and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
        words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
        LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
        they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
        house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
        abroad into the brook Kidron.

029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
        sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
        porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
        eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
        made an end.

029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
        cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
        offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
        table, with all the vessels thereof.

029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
        cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
        sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
        LORD.

029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
        the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
        lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
        and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
        priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
        LORD.

029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
        blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
        killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
        killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
        altar.

029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
        before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
        hands upon them:

029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
        their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
        Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
        sin offering should be made for all Israel.

029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
        with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
        of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
        for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
        priests with the trumpets.

029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
        altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
        began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
        ordained by David king of Israel.

029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
        the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
        offering was finished.

029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
        that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
        Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
        and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
        and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
        yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
        thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
        congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
        many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
        brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
        two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
        LORD.

029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
        thousand sheep.

029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
        the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
        help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
        priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
        upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
        of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
        burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
        set in order.

029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
        prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
        also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
        house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
        LORD God of Israel.

030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
        congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
        month.

030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
        had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
        people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
        all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
        to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
        for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
        written.

030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
        princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
        commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
        again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
        will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
        hand of the kings of Assyria.

030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
        trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
        therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
        yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
        he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
        the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
        children shall find compassion before them that lead them
        captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
        LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
        his face from you, if ye return unto him.

030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
        Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
        to scorn, and mocked them.

030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
        humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
        the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
        the LORD.

030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
        of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
        congregation.

030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
        Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
        cast them into the brook Kidron.

030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
        and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
        into the house of the LORD.

030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
        the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
        blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
        sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
        killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
        sanctify them unto the LORD.

030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
        Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
        yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
        But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
        every one

030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
        fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
        purification of the sanctuary.

030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
        the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
        and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
        singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
        taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
        throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
        making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
        and they kept other seven days with gladness.

030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
        thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
        gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
        sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
        Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
        the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
        dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
        in Jerusalem.

030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
        their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
        dwelling place, even unto heaven.

031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
        went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
        pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
        places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
        Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
        them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
        to his possession, into their own cities.

031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
        Levites after their courses, every man according to his
        service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
        peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
        praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
        burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
        offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
        the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
        law of the LORD.

031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
        give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
        might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
        Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
        oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
        tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
        the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
        and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
        unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
        heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
        blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
        concerning the heaps.

031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
        him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
        into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
        have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
        that which is left is this great store.

031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
        the LORD; and they prepared them,

031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
        things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
        and Shimei his brother was the next.

031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
        and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
        Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
        his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
        Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
        east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
        the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
        Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
        priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
        courses, as well to the great as to the small:

031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
        upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
        the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
        according to their courses;

031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
        fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
        their charges by their courses;

031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
        and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
        congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
        themselves in holiness:

031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
        fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
        the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
        the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
        genealogies among the Levites.

031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
        which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
        God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
        he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
        king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
        against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
        himself.

032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
        was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
        the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
        they did help him.

032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
        the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
        land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
        much water?

032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
        was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
        without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
        darts and shields in abundance.

032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
        together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
        spake comfortably to them, saying,

032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
        king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
        for there be more with us than with him:

032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
        to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
        themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
        to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
        all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
        all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
        that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
        by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
        deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
        altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
        worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
        people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
        lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
        fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
        of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
        of mine hand?

032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
        on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
        nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
        hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
        your God deliver you out of mine hand?

032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
        against his servant Hezekiah.

032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
        to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
        other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
        so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
        mine hand.

032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
        people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
        and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
        gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
        hands of man.

032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
        the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
        of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
        king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
        land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
        that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
        sword.

032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
        from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
        hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
        presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
        in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
        the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
        unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
        wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
        heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
        wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
        himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
        stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
        pleasant jewels;

032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
        and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
        herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
        Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
        city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
        Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
        done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
        all that was in his heart.

032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
        behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
        the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
        the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
        Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
        death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
        unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
        out before the children of Israel.

033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
        had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
        groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
        them.

033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
        LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
        enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
        spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
        the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
        house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
        his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
        before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
        the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
        will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
        to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
        hand of Moses.

033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
        err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
        destroyed before the children of Israel.

033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
        would not hearken.

033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
        of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
        and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
        and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
        his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
        kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
        the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
        at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
        a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
        cities of Judah.

033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
        house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
        mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
        them out of the city.

033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
        peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
        serve the LORD God of Israel.

033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
        places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
        God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
        of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel.

033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
        sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
        places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
        humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
        seers.

033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
        own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned two years in Jerusalem.

033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
        carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
        them;

033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
        father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
        own house.

033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
        to the right hand, nor to the left.

034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
        he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
        twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
        high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
        molten images.

034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
        the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
        groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
        in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
        graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
        cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
        Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
        beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
        idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
        Jerusalem.

034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
        the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
        and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
        Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
        the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
        Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
        Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
        all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
        oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
        workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
        amend the house:

034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
        stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
        the kings of Judah had destroyed.

034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
        were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
        and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
        set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
        of instruments of musick.

034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
        of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
        the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
        of the LORD given by Moses.

034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
        found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
        word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
        servants, they do it.

034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
        the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
        the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
        king.

034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        law, that he rent his clothes.

034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
        and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
        a servant of the king's, saying,

034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
        Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
        found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
        upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
        LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
        Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
        the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
        Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
        effect.

034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
        ye the man that sent you to me,

034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
        that are written in the book which they have read before the
        king of Judah:

034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
        upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
        before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
        and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
        before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
        have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
        gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
        all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
        inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
        priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
        and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
        covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
        the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
        commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
        his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
        covenant which are written in this book.

034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
        to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
        to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
        countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
        all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
        LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
        following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
        and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        first month.

035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
        to the service of the house of the LORD,

035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
        holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
        not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
        God, and his people Israel,

035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
        your courses, according to the writing of David king of
        Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
        families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
        the division of the families of the Levites.

035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
        your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
        LORD by the hand of Moses.

035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
        all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
        the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
        these were of the king's substance.

035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
        priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
        rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
        passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
        and three hundred oxen.

035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
        Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
        unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
        cattle, and five hundred oxen.

035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
        place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
        king's commandment.

035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
        blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
        according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
        offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
        And so did they with the oxen.

035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
        ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
        in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
        the people.

035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
        priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
        offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
        the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
        sons of Aaron.

035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
        according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
        and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
        gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
        brethren the Levites prepared for them.

035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
        keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
        of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
        at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
        days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
        Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
        and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
        passover kept.

035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
        king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
        Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
        thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
        but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
        me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
        with me, that he destroy thee not.

035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
        disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
        not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
        fight in the valley of Megiddo.

035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
        servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
        him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
        Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
        sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
        for Josiah.

035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
        the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
        this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
        they are written in the lamentations.

035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
        according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
        and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
        the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
        and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
        took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
        him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
        LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
        which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
        are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
        Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
        brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
        of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
        Jerusalem.

036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
        God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
        speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
        him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
        heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
        transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
        heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
        hallowed in Jerusalem.

036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
        messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
        compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
        and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
        against his people, till there was no remedy.

036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
        slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
        sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
        man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
        hand.

036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
        Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
        destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
        Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
        the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
        the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
        desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
        accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
        Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
        kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
        hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
        there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
        him, and let him go up.

Book 15	Ezra

001:001 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
        LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he
        made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
        also in writing, saying,

001:002 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
        given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

001:003 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
        and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
        the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
        in Jerusalem.

001:004 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
        the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
        with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
        the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

001:005 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
        and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
        God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
        is in Jerusalem.

001:006 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
        with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
        beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
        willingly offered.

001:007 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
        the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
        Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

001:008 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
        Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
        the prince of Judah.

001:009 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
        thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

001:010 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four
        hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

001:011 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and
        four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of
        the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
        Jerusalem.

002:001 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of
        the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto
        Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one
        unto his city;

002:002 Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
        Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
        The number of the men of the people of Israel:

        and four.

002:032 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

002:033 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and
        five.

002:034 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

002:035 The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and
        thirty.

002:036 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua,
        nine hundred seventy and three.

002:037 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

002:038 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and

        children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of
        Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all
        an hundred thirty and nine.

002:043 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha,
        the children of Tabbaoth,

002:044 The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of
        Padon,

002:045 The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children
        of Akkub,

002:046 The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children
        of Hanan,

002:047 The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of
        Reaiah,

002:048 The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of
        Gazzam,

002:049 The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of
        Besai,

002:050 The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children
        of Nephusim,

002:051 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
        of Harhur,

002:052 The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children
        of Harsha,

002:053 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
        of Thamah,

002:054 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

002:055 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
        children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,

002:056 The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children
        of Giddel,

002:057 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
        children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.

002:058 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

002:059 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
        Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their
        father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

002:060 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

002:061 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
        the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a
        wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was
        called after their name:

002:062 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

002:063 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and with Thummim.

002:064 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

002:065 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were
        seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were
        among them two hundred singing men and singing women.

002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
        two hundred forty and five;

002:067 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
        thousand seven hundred and twenty.

002:068 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
        house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for
        the house of God to set it up in his place:

002:069 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
        threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
        pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and
        the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
        their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

003:001 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
        Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves
        together as one man to Jerusalem.

003:002 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
        priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his
        brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer
        burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses
        the man of God.

003:003 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them
        because of the people of those countries: and they offered
        burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
        morning and evening.

003:004 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
        offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
        custom, as the duty of every day required;

003:005 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of
        the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were
        consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
        freewill offering unto the LORD.

003:006 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
        burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
        temple of the LORD was not yet laid.

003:007 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
        and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them
        of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of
        Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of
        Persia.

003:008 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
        at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
        their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
        were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed
        the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
        the work of the house of the LORD.

003:009 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
        his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
        workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their
        sons and their brethren the Levites.

003:010 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
        LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and
        the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
        LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

003:011 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
        unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
        ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great
        shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of
        the house of the LORD was laid.

003:012 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
        who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
        foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
        a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

003:013 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of
        joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
        people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
        off.

004:001 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
        children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God
        of Israel;

004:002 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
        and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
        God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
        Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.

004:003 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
        fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with
        us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together
        will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king
        of Persia hath commanded us.

004:004 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
        of Judah, and troubled them in building,

004:005 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
        purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
        reign of Darius king of Persia.

004:006 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
        wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

004:007 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
        Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king
        of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the
        Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

004:008 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
        against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

004:009 Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
        the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
        Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the
        Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites,
        and the Elamites,

004:010 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
        brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest
        that are on this side the river, and at such a time.

004:011 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
        unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side
        the river, and at such a time.

004:012 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
        thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious
        and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
        joined the foundations.

004:013 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
        and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll,
        tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of
        the kings.

004:014 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
        was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
        have we sent and certified the king;

004:015 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
        fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and
        know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
        kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within
        the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

004:016 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
        the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
        portion on this side the river.

004:017 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
        Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
        dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
        and at such a time.

004:018 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
        me.

004:019 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
        that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
        kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

004:020 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
        ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
        and custom, was paid unto them.

004:021 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
        this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
        given from me.

004:022 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
        grow to the hurt of the kings?

004:023 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
        Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
        went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
        cease by force and power.

004:024 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
        Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
        Darius king of Persia.

005:001 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
        of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and
        Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.

005:002 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
        son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
        at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
        them.

005:003 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
        the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said
        thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house,
        and to make up this wall?

005:004 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
        of the men that make this building?

005:005 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
        they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
        Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning
        this matter.

005:006 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
        river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites,
        which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

005:007 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
        Darius the king, all peace.

005:008 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
        Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with
        great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work
        goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

005:009 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who
        commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

005:010 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
        write the names of the men that were the chief of them.

005:011 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
        of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
        builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
        builded and set up.

005:012 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
        wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
        of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
        carried the people away into Babylon.

005:013 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
        king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

005:014 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
        which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in
        Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those
        did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they
        were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
        had made governor;

005:015 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
        temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
        builded in his place.

005:016 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
        house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
        until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
        finished.

005:017 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be
        search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at
        Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the
        king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
        send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

006:001 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
        house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
        Babylon.

006:002 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
        province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
        written:

006:003 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
        made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let
        the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices,
        and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
        thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore
        cubits;

006:004 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
        let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

006:005 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
        God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
        is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and
        brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one
        to his place, and place them in the house of God.

006:006 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
        Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which
        are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

006:007 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
        the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
        his place.

006:008 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
        these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
        king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
        expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.

006:009 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
        rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
        wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
        the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
        by day without fail:

006:010 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
        of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

006:011 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
        word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
        up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a
        dunghill for this.

006:012 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
        all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter
        and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I
        Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

006:013 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai,
        and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
        had sent, so they did speedily.

006:014 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
        the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
        Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the
        commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
        commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of
        Persia.

006:015 And this house was finished on the third day of the month
        Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
        king.

006:016 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
        the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
        of this house of God with joy.

006:017 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
        bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
        offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
        number of the tribes of Israel.

006:018 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
        in their courses, for the service of God, which is at
        Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

006:019 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
        fourteenth day of the first month.

006:020 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
        them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children
        of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
        themselves.

006:021 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
        captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
        from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
        LORD God of Israel, did eat,

006:022 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
        for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
        king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the
        work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

007:001 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
        Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
        of Hilkiah,

007:002 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

007:003 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

007:004 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

007:005 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
        the son of Aaron the chief priest:

007:006 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
        the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
        the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
        the LORD his God upon him.

007:007 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
        priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
        and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
        Artaxerxes the king.

007:008 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
        seventh year of the king.

007:009 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
        from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
        to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.

007:010 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
        and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

007:011 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
        gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the
        words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to
        Israel.

007:012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
        the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
        time.

007:013 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
        his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
        their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

007:014 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
        counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
        according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

007:015 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
        counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
        habitation is in Jerusalem,

007:016 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
        province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
        and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
        God which is in Jerusalem:

007:017 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
        lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
        and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
        is in Jerusalem.

007:018 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
        to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after
        the will of your God.

007:019 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
        house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
        Jerusalem.

007:020 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
        which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the
        king's treasure house.

007:021 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
        treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
        the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
        require of you, it be done speedily,

007:022 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
        of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
        baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

007:023 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
        diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
        should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
        sons?

007:024 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
        Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
        house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
        or custom, upon them.

007:025 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
        hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
        people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
        thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.

007:026 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
        the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
        it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of
        goods, or to imprisonment.

007:027 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
        thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
        the LORD which is in Jerusalem:

007:028 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
        counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I
        was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,
        and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with
        me.

008:001 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
        genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the
        reign of Artaxerxes the king.

008:002 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
        Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.

008:003 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
        and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an
        hundred and fifty.

008:004 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
        with him two hundred males.

008:005 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
        three hundred males.

008:006 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
        him fifty males.

008:007 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
        with him seventy males.

008:008 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
        and with him fourscore males.

008:009 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
        two hundred and eighteen males.

008:010 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
        him an hundred and threescore males.

008:011 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
        him twenty and eight males.

008:012 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
        with him an hundred and ten males.

008:013 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
        Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore
        males.

008:014 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
        seventy males.

008:015 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
        Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed
        the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons
        of Levi.

008:016 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
        Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
        for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
        and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

008:017 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
        place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto
        Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place
        Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the
        house of our God.

008:018 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man
        of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
        son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
        eighteen;

008:019 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
        his brethren and their sons, twenty;

008:020 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
        appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and
        twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

008:021 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
        might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
        way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
        substance.

008:022 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
        and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
        we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is
        upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
        wrath is against all them that forsake him.

008:023 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
        intreated of us.

008:024 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
        Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

008:025 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the
        king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there
        present, had offered:

008:026 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
        of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold
        an hundred talents;

008:027 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
        vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

008:028 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels
        are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill
        offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

008:029 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief
        of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
        Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
        LORD.

008:030 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto
        the house of our God.

008:031 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
        the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
        was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
        and of such as lay in wait by the way.

008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

008:033 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
        vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
        Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar
        the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
        Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

008:034 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
        written at that time.

008:035 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
        were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
        the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
        six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
        offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.

008:036 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
        lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
        they furthered the people, and the house of God.

009:001 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,
        saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
        Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
        lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
        Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
        Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

009:002 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
        their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
        the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and
        rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

009:003 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
        and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
        down astonied.

009:004 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
        words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of
        those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the
        evening sacrifice.

009:005 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
        having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,
        and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

009:006 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
        to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our
        head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

009:007 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
        unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
        our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
        lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
        confusion of face, as it is this day.

009:008 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the
        LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us
        a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
        and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

009:009 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
        bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
        kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of
        our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
        a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

009:010 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
        forsaken thy commandments,

009:011 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
        saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
        unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,
        with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
        another with their uncleanness.

009:012 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
        take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
        their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
        of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
        for ever.

009:013 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
        our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us
        less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
        deliverance as this;

009:014 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
        with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
        angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
        should be no remnant nor escaping?

009:015 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet
        escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
        trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

010:001 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
        and casting himself down before the house of God, there
        assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
        men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.

010:002 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
        answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
        God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
        yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

010:003 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
        all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
        counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
        commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the
        law.

010:004 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be
        with thee: be of good courage, and do it.

010:005 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and
        all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this
        word. And they sware.

010:006 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
        the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
        thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned
        because of the transgression of them that had been carried
        away.

010:007 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
        all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
        themselves together unto Jerusalem;

010:008 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according
        to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
        substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
        congregation of those that had been carried away.

010:009 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
        together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth
        month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people
        sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
        this matter, and for the great rain.

010:010 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
        transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
        trespass of Israel.

010:011 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your
        fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the
        people of the land, and from the strange wives.

010:012 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
        As thou hast said, so must we do.

010:013 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
        are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one
        day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this
        thing.

010:014 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
        them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
        appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and
        the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this
        matter be turned from us.

010:015 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
        were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai
        the Levite helped them.

010:016 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
        with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their
        fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and
        sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the
        matter.

010:017 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
        wives by the first day of the first month.

010:018 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
        taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of
        Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
        and Gedaliah.

010:019 And they gave their hands that they would put away their
        wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for
        their trespass.

010:020 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

010:021 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
        and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

010:022 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,

Book 16	Nehemiah

001:001 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
        pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
        Shushan the palace,

001:002 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
        Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
        which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

001:003 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
        captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
        reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
        gates thereof are burned with fire.

001:004 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
        and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
        before the God of heaven,

001:005 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
        terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
        love him and observe his commandments:

001:006 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
        mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
        thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
        servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
        which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
        house have sinned.

001:007 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
        the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
        thou commandedst thy servant Moses.

001:008 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
        servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
        abroad among the nations:

001:009 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
        though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
        the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
        them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.

001:010 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
        redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

001:011 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
        prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
        desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
        this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
        was the king's cupbearer.

002:001 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
        of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
        up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
        beforetime sad in his presence.

002:002 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
        seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
        heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

002:003 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
        not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
        fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
        consumed with fire?

002:004 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
        So I prayed to the God of heaven.

002:005 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
        servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
        send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
        that I may build it.

002:006 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
        For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
        So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

002:007 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
        letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
        they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

002:008 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
        he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
        palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
        city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
        granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

002:009 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
        the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
        and horsemen with me.

002:010 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there
        was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

002:011 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

002:012 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
        told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
        Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
        that I rode upon.

002:013 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
        the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
        Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
        consumed with fire.

002:014 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
        pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
        to pass.

002:015 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
        and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
        returned.

002:016 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
        had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
        the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
        work.

002:017 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
        Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
        fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
        be no more a reproach.

002:018 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me;
        as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
        said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
        hands for this good work.

002:019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
        scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
        do? will ye rebel against the king?

002:020 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
        he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
        build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
        Jerusalem.

003:001 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
        priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,
        and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they
        sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.

003:002 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
        builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

003:003 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also
        laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the
        locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:004 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
        son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired
        Zadok the son of Baana.

003:005 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
        not their necks to the work of their LORD.

003:006 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
        Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof,
        and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
        bars thereof.

003:007 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
        the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the
        throne of the governor on this side the river.

003:008 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
        goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of
        one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the
        broad wall.

003:009 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
        of the half part of Jerusalem.

003:010 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even
        over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the
        son of Hashabniah.

003:011 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
        repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

003:012 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
        ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

003:013 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
        they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
        thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the
        wall unto the dung gate.

003:014 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
        ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the
        doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:015 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
        Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and
        covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,
        and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by
        the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the
        city of David.

003:016 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
        half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the
        sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
        the house of the mighty.

003:017 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next
        unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of
        Keilah, in his part.

003:018 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
        the ruler of the half part of Keilah.

003:019 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of
        Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
        at the turning of the wall.

003:020 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
        other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the
        house of Eliashib the high priest.

003:021 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
        another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to
        the end of the house of Eliashib.

003:022 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

003:023 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
        house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son
        of Ananiah by his house.

003:024 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
        from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even
        unto the corner.

003:025 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall,
        and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that
        was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
        Parosh.

003:026 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
        against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that
        lieth out.

003:027 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against
        the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

003:028 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
        against his house.

003:029 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his
        house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah,
        the keeper of the east gate.

003:030 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
        the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired
        Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.

003:031 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place
        of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate
        Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.

003:032 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
        repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

004:001 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
        the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked
        the Jews.

004:002 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
        said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
        will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
        revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
        burned?

004:003 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
        which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
        their stone wall.

004:004 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
        upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
        captivity:

004:005 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
        out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger
        before the builders.

004:006 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
        unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

004:007 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
        Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
        the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
        began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

004:008 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
        against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

004:009 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
        against them day and night, because of them.

004:010 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
        decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
        build the wall.

004:011 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
        till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
        the work to cease.

004:012 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
        came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
        shall return unto us they will be upon you.

004:013 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
        the higher places, I even set the people after their families
        with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

004:014 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
        the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
        them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
        fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
        wives, and your houses.

004:015 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
        unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
        returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

004:016 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
        servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
        both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
        habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.

004:017 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
        with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
        in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.

004:018 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
        and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

004:019 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
        of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
        separated upon the wall, one far from another.

004:020 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
        resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

004:021 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
        from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

004:022 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
        one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
        they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.

004:023 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
        the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
        saving that every one put them off for washing.

005:001 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
        against their brethren the Jews.

005:002 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
        many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
        live.

005:003 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
        vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
        dearth.

005:004 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
        king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

005:005 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
        children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
        sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
        daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
        our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
        vineyards.

005:006 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

005:007 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
        the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
        his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

005:008 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
        brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
        ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
        Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.

005:009 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
        in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
        our enemies?

005:010 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
        them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

005:011 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
        their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
        hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
        the oil, that ye exact of them.

005:012 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
        of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
        priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
        according to this promise.

005:013 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
        his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
        promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
        congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
        did according to this promise.

005:014 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
        governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
        unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that
        is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
        of the governor.

005:015 But the former governors that had been before me were
        chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and
        wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants
        bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
        fear of God.

005:016 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
        we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto
        the work.

005:017 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the
        Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
        heathen that are about us.

005:018 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
        choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten
        days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
        I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy
        upon this people.

005:019 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
        done for this people.

006:001 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
        Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
        the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though
        at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

006:002 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
        meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.
        But they thought to do me mischief.

006:003 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great
        work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
        whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

006:004 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
        answered them after the same manner.

006:005 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
        fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

006:006 Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and
        Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
        which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
        king, according to these words.

006:007 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
        Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it
        be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
        therefore, and let us take counsel together.

006:008 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
        thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

006:009 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
        weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
        God, strengthen my hands.

006:010 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
        the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us
        meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let
        us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
        thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

006:011 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,
        that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his
        life? I will not go in.

006:012 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
        pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat
        had hired him.

006:013 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
        and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report,
        that they might reproach me.

006:014 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
        these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest
        of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

006:015 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
        month Elul, in fifty and two days.

006:016 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,
        and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they
        were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that
        this work was wrought of our God.

006:017 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
        unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

006:018 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was
        the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
        Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah.

006:019 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
        words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

007:001 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
        the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
        were appointed,

007:002 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
        palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and
        feared God above many.

007:003 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
        until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut
        the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every
        one to be over against his house.

007:004 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few
        therein, and the houses were not builded.

007:005 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
        and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
        genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
        which came up at the first, and found written therein,

007:006 These are the children of the province, that went up out of
        the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
        again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

007:007 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
        Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
        The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was
        this;

007:008 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and
        two.

007:009 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

007:010 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

        hundred forty and three.

007:031 The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.

007:032 The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.

007:034 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty
        and four.

007:035 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

007:036 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

007:037 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and

        nine hundred seventy and three.

007:040 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

007:041 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and
        seven.

007:042 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.

007:043 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the
        children of Hodevah, seventy and four.

007:045 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater,
        the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of
        Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

007:046 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha,
        the children of Tabbaoth,

007:047 The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of
        Padon,

007:048 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children
        of Shalmai,

007:049 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of
        Gahar,

007:050 The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of
        Nekoda,

007:051 The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of
        Phaseah,

007:052 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of
        Nephishesim,

007:053 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
        of Harhur,

007:054 The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children
        of Harsha,

007:055 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
        of Tamah,

007:056 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

007:057 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
        children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

007:058 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of
        Giddel,

007:059 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
        children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.

007:060 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

007:061 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah,
        Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew
        their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of
        Israel.

007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

007:063 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
        Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the
        daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called
        after their name.

007:064 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

007:065 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and Thummim.

007:066 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

007:067 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there
        were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they
        had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

007:068 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
        hundred forty and five:

007:069 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
        hundred and twenty asses.

007:070 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
        Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
        basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

007:071 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
        the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
        two hundred pound of silver.

007:072 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
        drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
        threescore and seven priests' garments.

007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
        singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
        Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month
        came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

008:001 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
        into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
        unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses,
        which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

008:002 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
        both of men and women, and all that could hear with
        understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

008:003 And he read therein before the street that was before the
        water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and
        the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of
        all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.

008:004 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
        had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
        Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on
        his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
        and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
        Meshullam.

008:005 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
        he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
        people stood up:

008:006 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
        answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they
        bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to
        the ground.

008:007 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
        Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
        Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to
        understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

008:008 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
        gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

008:009 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
        scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
        the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn
        not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the
        words of the law.

008:010 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
        the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
        prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye
        sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

008:011 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
        peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

008:012 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
        send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
        understood the words that were declared unto them.

008:013 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
        fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
        Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

008:014 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded
        by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths
        in the feast of the seventh month:

008:015 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
        and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch
        olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
        palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
        it is written.

008:016 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made
        themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and
        in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in
        the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
        Ephraim.

008:017 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
        the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
        the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
        children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

008:018 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
        in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
        days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
        unto the manner.

009:001 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
        Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
        earth upon them.

009:002 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
        strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the
        iniquities of their fathers.

009:003 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
        law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and
        another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD
        their God.

009:004 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
        Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani,
        and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.

009:005 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
        Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up
        and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
        thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
        praise.

009:006 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
        heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
        things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,
        and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
        worshippeth thee.

009:007 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
        broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
        the name of Abraham;

009:008 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
        covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
        Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
        and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast
        performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

009:009 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
        heardest their cry by the Red sea;

009:010 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
        servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
        that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
        name, as it is this day.

009:011 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
        through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
        persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
        mighty waters.

009:012 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and
        in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
        way wherein they should go.

009:013 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
        from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
        good statutes and commandments:

009:014 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
        them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
        servant:

009:015 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
        broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their
        thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
        the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

009:016 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
        necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,

009:017 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that
        thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
        rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but
        thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
        anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.

009:018 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
        thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
        great provocations;

009:019 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
        wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
        day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
        night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.

009:020 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
        withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them
        water for their thirst.

009:021 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
        that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
        their feet swelled not.

009:022 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
        divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
        and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king
        of Bashan.

009:023 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
        and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst
        promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess
        it.

009:024 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
        subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
        Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their
        kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
        them as they would.

009:025 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
        houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
        oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
        were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
        great goodness.

009:026 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
        and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
        which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
        wrought great provocations.

009:027 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
        enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble,
        when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and
        according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
        who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

009:028 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
        therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so
        that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
        and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many
        times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

009:029 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
        again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
        unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
        (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the
        shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.

009:030 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
        against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
        give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the
        people of the lands.

009:031 Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
        utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
        gracious and merciful God.

009:032 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
        terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
        trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on
        our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
        prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
        time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

009:033 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
        hast done right, but we have done wickedly:

009:034 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
        fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
        thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.

009:035 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
        great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
        land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
        their wicked works.

009:036 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
        gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
        thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

009:037 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
        set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
        our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
        in great distress.

009:038 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
        and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

010:001 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son
        of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

010:002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

010:003 Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

010:004 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

010:005 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

010:006 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

010:007 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

010:008 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

010:009 And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
        sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

010:010 And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah,
        Hanan,

010:011 Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

010:012 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

010:013 Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

010:014 The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu,
        Bani,

010:015 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

010:016 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

010:017 Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,

010:018 Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

010:019 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

010:020 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

010:021 Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,

010:022 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

010:023 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

010:024 Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

010:025 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

010:026 And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

010:027 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

010:028 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
        porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
        separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law
        of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
        one having knowledge, and having understanding;

010:029 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
        curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
        by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
        commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his
        statutes;

010:030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
        the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

010:031 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
        the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on
        the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the
        seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

010:032 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
        with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house
        of our God;

010:033 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
        for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
        moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for
        the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all
        the work of the house of our God.

010:034 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
        people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of
        our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed
        year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
        it is written in the law:

010:035 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
        firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
        house of the LORD:

010:036 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
        written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our
        flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
        that minister in the house of our God:

010:037 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
        offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
        of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
        God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the
        same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our
        tillage.

010:038 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
        when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up
        the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the
        chambers, into the treasure house.

010:039 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
        bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
        unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and
        the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers:
        and we will not forsake the house of our God.

011:001 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of
        the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
        Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other
        cities.

011:002 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
        themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

011:003 Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in
        Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his
        possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
        the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's
        servants.

011:004 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and
        of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah
        the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah,
        the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children
        of Perez;

011:005 And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son
        of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
        Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

011:006 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four
        hundred threescore and eight valiant men.

011:007 And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of
        Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of
        Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
        Jesaiah.

011:008 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

011:009 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the
        son of Senuah was second over the city.

011:010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

011:011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
        Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler
        of the house of God.

011:012 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
        hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
        Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

011:013 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
        two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the
        son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

011:014 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty
        and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of
        the great men.

011:015 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

011:016 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had
        the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

011:017 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
        Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:
        and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son
        of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

011:018 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore
        and four.

011:019 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
        kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

011:020 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites,
        were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

011:021 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
        the Nethinims.

011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
        of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
        of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
        business of the house of God.

011:023 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a
        certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

011:024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
        the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
        concerning the people.

011:025 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
        of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof,
        and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel,
        and in the villages thereof,

011:026 And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

011:027 And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages
        thereof,

011:028 And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

011:029 And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the
        fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And
        they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

011:031 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
        Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

011:032 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

011:036 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
        Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
        Jeremiah, Ezra,

012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

012:003 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

012:004 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

012:005 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the
        priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

012:008 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah,
        Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and
        his brethren.

012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against
        them in the watches.

012:010 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
        Eliashib begat Joiada,

012:011 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

012:012 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
        fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

012:013 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

012:014 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

012:015 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

012:016 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

012:017 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

012:018 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

012:019 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

012:020 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

012:021 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

012:022 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
        Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests,
        to the reign of Darius the Persian.

012:023 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in
        the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the
        son of Eliashib.

012:024 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
        the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to
        praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of
        David the man of God, ward over against ward.

012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
        were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
        of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of
        Ezra the priest, the scribe.

012:027 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
        Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
        to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings,
        and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

012:028 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
        out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
        villages of Netophathi;

012:029 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
        and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round
        about Jerusalem.

012:030 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
        purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
        appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,
        whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
        dung gate:

012:032 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of
        Judah,

012:033 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

012:035 And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely,
        Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
        Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Asaph:

012:036 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
        Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical
        instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
        before them.

012:037 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they
        went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of
        the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate
        eastward.

012:038 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over
        against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
        upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto
        the broad wall;

012:039 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
        and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the
        tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still
        in the prison gate.

012:040 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the
        house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

012:041 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah,
        Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

012:042 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
        Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers
        sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

012:043 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
        God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and
        the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
        even afar off.

012:044 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
        treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the
        tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities
        the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah
        rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

012:045 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
        God, and the ward of the purification, according to the
        commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
        the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

012:047 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
        Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
        every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
        the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children
        of Aaron.

013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
        the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite
        and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God
        for ever;

013:002 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
        with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
        curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

013:003 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
        separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

013:004 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
        the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

013:005 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
        they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the
        vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the
        oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the
        singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

013:006 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
        and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto
        the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

013:007 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
        Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
        courts of the house of God.

013:008 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
        household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
        brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
        offering and the frankincense.

013:010 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
        given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
        work, were fled every one to his field.

013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
        of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
        their place.

013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
        and the oil unto the treasuries.

013:013 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
        priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
        next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
        was to distribute unto their brethren.

013:014 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
        good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
        the offices thereof.

013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
        sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
        wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
        brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
        against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

013:016 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
        all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
        of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
        What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
        day?

013:018 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
        evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
        Israel by profaning the sabbath.

013:019 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
        be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
        be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
        the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
        there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
        without Jerusalem once or twice.

013:021 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
        ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
        From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

013:022 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
        themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
        sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
        this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
        mercy.

013:023 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of
        Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:

013:024 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
        could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
        language of each people.

013:025 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
        of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
        God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
        nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
        many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
        his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless
        even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

013:027 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
        transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

013:028 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
        priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I
        chased him from me.

013:029 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
        priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
        Levites.

013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
        wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
        business;

013:031 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
        firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Book 17	Esther

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is
        Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over
        an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

001:002 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne
        of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

001:003 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
        princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
        nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

001:004 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
        honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and
        fourscore days.

001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
        all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
        unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
        of the king's palace;

001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
        cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
        marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
        red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

001:007 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
        being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
        according to the state of the king.

001:008 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
        for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
        house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
        house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
        wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
        Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that
        served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

001:011 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
        royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
        was fair to look on.

001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
        by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and
        his anger burned in him.

001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
        so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and
        judgment:

001:014 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
        Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
        Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the
        first in the kingdom;)

001:015 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
        because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
        Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

001:016 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
        the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to
        all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
        provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

001:017 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
        so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when
        it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
        queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

001:018 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
        unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
        the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

001:019 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
        him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and
        the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
        before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate
        unto another that is better than she.

001:020 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
        published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all
        the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great
        and small.

001:021 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
        did according to the word of Memucan:

001:022 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
        province according to the writing thereof, and to every people
        after their language, that every man should bear rule in his
        own house, and that it should be published according to the
        language of every people.

002:001 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
        appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
        what was decreed against her.

002:002 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
        there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

002:003 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
        kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young
        virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women,
        unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the
        women; and let their things for purification be given them:

002:004 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
        Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

002:005 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
        was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
        Kish, a Benjamite;

002:006 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
        which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

002:007 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's
        daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
        was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
        mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

002:008 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
        was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
        Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
        brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
        keeper of the women.

002:009 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
        and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
        such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were
        meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he
        preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
        of the women.

002:010 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
        had charged her that she should not shew it.

002:011 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
        house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

002:012 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
        Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
        the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
        purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of
        myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things
        for the purifying of the women;)

002:013 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
        desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
        women unto the king's house.

002:014 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
        the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
        the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
        unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and
        that she were called by name.

002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
        of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to
        go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
        king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
        Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
        upon her.

002:016 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
        in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
        year of his reign.

002:017 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
        obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the
        virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and
        made her queen instead of Vashti.

002:018 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
        servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
        provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

002:019 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
        then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

002:020 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as
        Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
        Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

002:021 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
        the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
        kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
        Ahasuerus.

002:022 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
        the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
        name.

002:023 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
        therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
        in the book of the chronicles before the king.

003:001 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
        Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
        above all the princes that were with him.

003:002 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
        bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
        concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

003:003 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
        unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
        hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
        Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
        was a Jew.

003:005 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
        reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

003:006 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
        had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
        to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
        of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

003:007 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
        year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
        before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
        twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

003:008 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
        scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
        provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
        people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
        for the king's profit to suffer them.

003:009 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
        destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to
        the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
        bring it into the king's treasuries.

003:010 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
        Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

003:011 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
        people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

003:012 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
        the first month, and there was written according to all that
        Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
        governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of
        every people of every province according to the writing
        thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
        of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's
        ring.

003:013 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
        provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all
        Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
        day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
        is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

003:014 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, that they should be
        ready against that day.

003:015 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
        and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king
        and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
        perplexed.

004:001 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
        clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
        the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

004:002 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter
        into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

004:003 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
        and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
        and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
        sackcloth and ashes.

004:004 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.
        Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
        to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him:
        but he received it not.

004:005 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
        whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
        commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

004:006 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
        which was before the king's gate.

004:007 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
        of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
        king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

004:008 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
        was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther,
        and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
        go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to
        make request before him for her people.

004:009 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

004:010 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
        Mordecai;

004:011 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's
        provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women,
        shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
        called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except
        such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
        he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the
        king these thirty days.

004:012 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

004:013 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with
        thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than
        all the Jews.

004:014 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
        shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
        another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
        destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
        kingdom for such a time as this?

004:015 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

004:016 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
        and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
        night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
        will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law:
        and if I perish, I perish.

004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
        had commanded him.

005:001 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
        royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's
        house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon
        his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
        the house.

005:002 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
        the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
        held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So
        Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

005:003 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
        what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
        of the kingdom.

005:004 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
        king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
        prepared for him.

005:005 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
        as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
        that Esther had prepared.

005:006 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is
        thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
        request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
        performed.

005:007 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

005:008 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
        please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
        request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
        shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king
        hath said.

005:009 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
        but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
        not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
        Mordecai.

005:010 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
        he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

005:011 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
        multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king
        had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
        princes and servants of the king.

005:012 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
        in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
        myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
        king.

005:013 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
        the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

005:014 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
        gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
        unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go
        thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing
        pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

006:001 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
        bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were
        read before the king.

006:002 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
        and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
        door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

006:003 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
        Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
        ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.

006:004 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
        into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
        king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
        him.

006:005 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
        in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

006:006 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
        done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now
        Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to
        do honour more than to myself?

006:007 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
        delighteth to honour,

006:008 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
        and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
        which is set upon his head:

006:009 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
        of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
        withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
        horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
        him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
        to honour.

006:010 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
        and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
        the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
        all that thou hast spoken.

006:011 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
        Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
        the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
        unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
        to his house mourning, and having his head covered.

006:013 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
        that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
        wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
        whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
        him, but shalt surely fall before him.

006:014 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
        chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
        Esther had prepared.

007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

007:002 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
        banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it
        shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall
        be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

007:003 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
        favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
        life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be
        slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
        bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
        countervail the king's damage.

007:005 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
        queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
        heart to do so?

007:006 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
        Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

007:007 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
        went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
        request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that
        there was evil determined against him by the king.

007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
        of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed
        whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the
        queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of
        king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

007:009 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
        Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
        made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in
        the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
        Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

008:001 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
        Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before
        the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.

008:002 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
        and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the
        house of Haman.

008:003 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at
        his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
        of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
        against the Jews.

008:004 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
        Esther arose, and stood before the king,

008:005 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
        sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
        pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
        devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
        wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's
        provinces:

008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
        people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
        kindred?

008:007 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
        Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
        Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he
        laid his hand upon the Jews.

008:008 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
        name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which
        is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
        ring, may no man reverse.

008:009 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
        month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
        day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
        commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the
        deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto
        Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
        province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
        people after their language, and to the Jews according to
        their writing, and according to their language.

008:010 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with
        the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and
        riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

008:011 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
        gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to
        destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the
        people and province that would assault them, both little ones
        and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

008:012 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
        upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
        month Adar.

008:013 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, and that the Jews
        should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their
        enemies.

008:014 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
        hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the
        decree was given at Shushan the palace.

008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
        apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
        with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
        Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

008:016 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

008:017 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
        king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and
        gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of
        the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

009:001 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
        thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and
        his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that
        the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
        it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
        them that hated them;)

009:002 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
        throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay
        hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand
        them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

009:003 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
        the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews;
        because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
        out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed
        greater and greater.

009:005 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
        sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
        unto those that hated them.

009:006 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
        hundred men.

009:007 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

009:008 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

009:009 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

009:010 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
        Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

009:011 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
        palace was brought before the king.

009:012 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
        and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the
        ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the
        king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be
        granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
        done.

009:013 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
        the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according
        unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
        upon the gallows.

009:014 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
        given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

009:015 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
        on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
        hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
        hand.

009:016 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
        themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest
        from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
        thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

009:017 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
        day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
        gladness.

009:018 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
        thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on
        the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
        of feasting and gladness.

009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
        towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
        gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
        one to another.

009:020 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
        Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
        both nigh and far,

009:021 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
        fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
        same, yearly,

009:022 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
        the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
        from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days
        of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another,
        and gifts to the poor.

009:023 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
        Mordecai had written unto them;

009:024 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
        all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
        and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
        destroy them;

009:025 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
        that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
        should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
        should be hanged on the gallows.

009:026 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
        Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which
        they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
        them,

009:027 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
        and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
        should not fail, that they would keep these two days according
        to their writing, and according to their appointed time every
        year;

009:028 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
        every generation, every family, every province, and every
        city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among
        the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
        the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second
        letter of Purim.

009:030 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
        twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
        words of peace and truth,

009:031 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
        according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
        enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for
        their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

009:032 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
        it was written in the book.

010:001 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon
        the isles of the sea.

010:002 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
        declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
        advanced him, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
        among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
        seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all
        his seed.

Book 18	Job

001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
        that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
        eschewed evil.

001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
        thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
        hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
        man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
        day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
        drink with them.

001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
        about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
        the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
        number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
        sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
        continually.

001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
        answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
        earth, and from walking up and down in it.

001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
        nought?

001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
        and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
        land.

001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
        he will curse thee to thy face.

001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
        thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
        Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
        eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
        plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
        have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
        am escaped alone to tell thee.

001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
        sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
        escaped alone to tell thee.

001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
        and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
        thee.

001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
        their eldest brother's house:

001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
        smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
        young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
        tell thee.

001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
        fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,

001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
        shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
        away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
        present himself before the LORD.

002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
        Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
        the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
        still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
        against him, to destroy him without cause.

002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
        that a man hath will he give for his life.

002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
        flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
        save his life.

002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
        Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
        sat down among the ashes.

002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
        integrity? curse God, and die.

002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
        women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
        God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
        sin with his lips.

002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
        come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
        the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
        Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
        to mourn with him and to comfort him.

002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
        they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
        his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
        nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
        grief was very great.

003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

003:002 And Job spake, and said,

003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
        it was said, There is a man child conceived.

003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
        neither let the light shine upon it.

003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
        dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
        joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
        number of the months.

003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
        therein.

003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
        up their mourning.

003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
        light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
        day:

003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
        sorrow from mine eyes.

003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
        when I came out of the belly?

003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
        suck?

003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
        slept: then had I been at rest,

003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
        places for themselves;

003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
        silver:

003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
        which never saw light.

003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
        at rest.

003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
        the oppressor.

003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
        his master.

003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
        unto the bitter in soul;

003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
        than for hid treasures;

003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
        the grave?

003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
        hath hedged in?

003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
        out like the waters.

003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
        which I was afraid of is come unto me.

003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
        yet trouble came.

004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
        who can withhold himself from speaking?

004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
        the weak hands.

004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
        strengthened the feeble knees.

004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
        thee, and thou art troubled.

004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
        uprightness of thy ways?

004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
        where were the righteous cut off?

004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
        wickedness, reap the same.

004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
        nostrils are they consumed.

004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
        the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
        whelps are scattered abroad.

004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
        a little thereof.

004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
        falleth on men,

004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
        shake.

004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
        stood up:

004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
        image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a
        voice, saying,

004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
        pure than his maker?

004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
        charged with folly:

004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
        foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
        ever without any regarding it.

004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
        even without wisdom.

005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
        of the saints wilt thou turn?

005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
        one.

005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
        habitation.

005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
        gate, neither is there any to deliver them.

005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
        the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
        trouble spring out of the ground;

005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
        without number:

005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
        fields:

005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
        may be exalted to safety.

005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
        hands cannot perform their enterprise.

005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
        the froward is carried headlong.

005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the
        noonday as in the night.

005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
        from the hand of the mighty.

005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore
        despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
        make whole.

005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there
        shall no evil touch thee.

005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
        power of the sword.

005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither
        shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou
        be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
        the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
        thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
        offspring as the grass of the earth.

005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
        corn cometh in in his season.

005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou
        it for thy good.

006:001 But Job answered and said,

006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
        in the balances together!

006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
        therefore my words are swallowed up.

006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
        whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
        themselves in array against me.

006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
        over his fodder?

006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
        any taste in the white of an egg?

006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful
        meat.

006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me
        the thing that I long for!

006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
        loose his hand, and cut me off!

006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
        sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
        of the Holy One.

006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
        that I should prolong my life?

006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of
        brass?

006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his
        friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the
        stream of brooks they pass away;

006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow
        is hid:

006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
        consumed out of their place.

006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
        and perish.

006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
        them.

006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came
        thither, and were ashamed.

006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are
        afraid.

006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
        substance?

006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the
        hand of the mighty?

006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to
        understand wherein I have erred.

006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing
        reprove?

006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
        is desperate, which are as wind?

006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your
        friend.

006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
        you if I lie.

006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
        my righteousness is in it.

006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern
        perverse things?

007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his
        days also like the days of an hireling?

007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
        looketh for the reward of his work:

007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
        are appointed to me.

007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
        gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
        the day.

007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
        broken, and become loathsome.

007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
        without hope.

007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see
        good.

007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine
        eyes are upon me, and I am not.

007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
        down to the grave shall come up no more.

007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
        know him any more.

007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
        anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my
        soul.

007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
        complaints;

007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
        visions:

007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my
        life.

007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
        are vanity.

007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
        shouldest set thine heart upon him?

007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
        every moment?

007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
        swallow down my spittle?

007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of
        men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am
        a burden to myself?

007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
        my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt
        seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the
        words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
        justice?

008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
        away for their transgression;

008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
        supplication to the Almighty;

008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
        thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
        greatly increase.

008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
        thyself to the search of their fathers:

008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
        days upon earth are a shadow:)

008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
        of their heart?

008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without
        water?

008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it
        withereth before any other herb.

008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's
        hope shall perish:

008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a
        spider's web.

008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
        hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
        his garden.

008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
        stones.

008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,
        saying, I have not seen thee.

008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
        others grow.

008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
        help the evil doers:

008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with
        rejoicing.

008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the
        dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

009:001 Then Job answered and said,

009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with
        God?

009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
        thousand.

009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
        himself against him, and hath prospered?

009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
        overturneth them in his anger.

009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
        thereof tremble.

009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
        the stars.

009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
        waves of the sea.

009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
        of the south.

009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
        without number.

009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but
        I perceive him not.

009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
        him, What doest thou?

009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
        under him.

009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
        reason with him?

009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I
        would make supplication to my judge.

009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not
        believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
        without cause.

009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
        bitterness.

009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,
        who shall set me a time to plead?

009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I
        say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
        despise my life.

009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the
        perfect and the wicked.

009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of
        the innocent.

009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth
        the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see
        no good.

009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
        hasteth to the prey.

009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
        heaviness, and comfort myself:

009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold
        me innocent.

009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
        clean;

009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
        shall abhor me.

009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
        should come together in judgment.

009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his
        hand upon us both.

009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
        terrify me:

009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with
        me.

010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
        myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
        contendest with me.

010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
        shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the
        counsel of the wicked?

010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after
        my sin?

010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can
        deliver out of thine hand.

010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round
        about; yet thou dost destroy me.

010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
        and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
        cheese?

010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
        with bones and sinews.

010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
        preserved my spirit.

010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
        this is with thee.

010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
        from mine iniquity.

010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
        not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see
        thou mine affliction;

010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again
        thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
        indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
        that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have
        been carried from the womb to the grave.

010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
        take comfort a little,

010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of
        darkness and the shadow of death;

010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of
        death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
        man full of talk be justified?

011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
        mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in
        thine eyes.

011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they
        are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth
        of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
        Almighty unto perfection?

011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
        what canst thou know?

011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than
        the sea.

011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
        hinder him?

011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not
        then consider it?

011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild
        ass's colt.

011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
        toward him;

011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
        wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
        shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as
        waters that pass away:

011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt
        shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou
        shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
        yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
        escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

012:001 And Job answered and said,

012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
        you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
        he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised
        in the thought of him that is at ease.

012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
        are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
        fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes
        of the sea shall declare unto thee.

012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
        wrought this?

012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the
        breath of all mankind.

012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days
        understanding.

012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
        understanding.

012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
        shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
        sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
        are his.

012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
        fools.

012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
        girdle.

012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
        understanding of the aged.

012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength
        of the mighty.

012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out
        to light the shadow of death.

012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth
        the nations, and straiteneth them again.

012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
        earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
        is no way.

012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
        stagger like a drunken man.

013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
        understood it.

013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
        you.

013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
        with God.

013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
        your wisdom.

013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
        lips.

013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
        mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
        upon you?

013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
        of clay.

013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come
        on me what will.

013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
        mine hand?

013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
        maintain mine own ways before him.

013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
        before him.

013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
        justified.

013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
        tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself
        from thee.

013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
        afraid.

013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
        thou me.

013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
        transgression and my sin.

013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine
        enemy?

013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
        the dry stubble?

013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to
        possess the iniquities of my youth.

013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
        unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my
        feet.

013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is
        moth eaten.

014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of
        trouble.

014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
        as a shadow, and continueth not.

014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
        me into judgment with thee?

014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
        with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as
        an hireling, his day.

014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
        sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
        cease.

014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
        thereof die in the ground;

014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
        boughs like a plant.

014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
        and where is he?

014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
        drieth up:

014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
        more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
        keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest
        appoint me a set time, and remember me!

014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
        appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a
        desire to the work of thine hands.

014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
        sin?

014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
        mine iniquity.

014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the
        rock is removed out of his place.

014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
        grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the
        hope of man.

014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
        changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
        brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within
        him shall mourn.

015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly
        with the east wind?

015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches
        wherewith he can do no good?

015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
        tongue of the crafty.

015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own
        lips testify against thee.

015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
        the hills?

015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain
        wisdom to thyself?

015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,
        which is not in us?

015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
        than thy father.

015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
        secret thing with thee?

015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes
        wink at,

015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such
        words go out of thy mouth?

015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
        a woman, that he should be righteous?

015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens
        are not clean in his sight.

015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
        iniquity like water?

015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
        declare;

015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
        it:

015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed
        among them.

015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the
        number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
        shall come upon him.

015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he
        is waited for of the sword.

015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
        that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
        against him, as a king ready to the battle.

015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
        himself against the Almighty.

015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses
        of his bucklers:

015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh
        collops of fat on his flanks.

015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
        inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
        neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the
        earth.

015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up
        his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
        be his recompence.

015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
        not be green.

015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
        cast off his flower as the olive.

015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
        shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
        belly prepareth deceit.

016:001 Then Job answered and said,

016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye
        all.

016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
        thou answerest?

016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's
        stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head
        at you.

016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
        lips should asswage your grief.

016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I
        forbear, what am I eased?

016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
        company.

016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness
        against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
        my face.

016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
        with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
        upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
        together against me.

016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
        the hands of the wicked.

016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
        taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up
        for his mark.

016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
        asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
        ground.

016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
        like a giant.

016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
        the dust.

016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow
        of death;

016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no
        place.

016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
        high.

016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth
        for his neighbour!

016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I
        shall not return.

017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are
        ready for me.

017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
        in their provocation?

017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
        will strike hands with me?

017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore
        shalt thou not exalt them.

017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
        children shall fail.

017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
        was as a tabret.

017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members
        are as a shadow.

017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
        stir up himself against the hypocrite.

017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath
        clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
        find one wise man among you.

017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the
        thoughts of my heart.

017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
        darkness.

017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
        darkness.

017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,
        Thou art my mother, and my sister.

017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
        together is in the dust.

018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and
        afterwards we will speak.

018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
        sight?

018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
        for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark
        of his fire shall not shine.

018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle
        shall be put out with him.

018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
        counsel shall cast him down.

018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon
        a snare.

018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall
        prevail against him.

018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
        the way.

018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
        him to his feet.

018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
        ready at his side.

018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn
        of death shall devour his strength.

018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
        shall bring him to the king of terrors.

018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
        brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
        branch be cut off.

018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
        no name in the street.

018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
        the world.

018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
        remaining in his dwellings.

018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
        that went before were affrighted.

018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
        place of him that knoweth not God.

019:001 Then Job answered and said,

019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
        words?

019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that
        ye make yourselves strange to me.

019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
        myself.

019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
        against me my reproach:

019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
        with his net.

019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
        but there is no judgment.

019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
        darkness in my paths.

019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
        head.

019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
        hope hath he removed like a tree.

019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
        unto him as one of his enemies.

019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
        and encamp round about my tabernacle.

019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
        verily estranged from me.

019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
        forgotten me.

019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
        stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
        with my mouth.

019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
        children's sake of mine own body.

019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
        against me.

019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
        turned against me.

019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
        with the skin of my teeth.

019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
        hand of God hath touched me.

019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
        flesh?

019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
        in a book!

019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
        for ever!

019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
        the latter day upon the earth:

019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
        flesh shall I see God:

019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
        not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of
        the matter is found in me?

019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments
        of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I
        make haste.

020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
        understanding causeth me to answer.

020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
        hypocrite but for a moment?

020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
        reach unto the clouds;

020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
        have seen him shall say, Where is he?

020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
        shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither
        shall his place any more behold him.

020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands
        shall restore their goods.

020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie
        down with him in the dust.

020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
        under his tongue;

020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
        within his mouth:

020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
        within him.

020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
        again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall
        slay him.

020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey
        and butter.

020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
        swallow it down: according to his substance shall the
        restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because
        he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not
        save of that which he desired.

020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
        look for his goods.

020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
        every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
        his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is
        eating.

020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
        strike him through.

020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
        sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not
        blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
        in his tabernacle.

020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
        up against him.

020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall
        flow away in the day of his wrath.

020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
        appointed unto him by God.

021:001 But Job answered and said,

021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
        on.

021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why
        should not my spirit be troubled?

021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on
        my flesh.

021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
        power?

021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
        offspring before their eyes.

021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God
        upon them.

021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
        casteth not her calf.

021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
        children dance.

021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of
        the organ.

021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to
        the grave.

021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
        the knowledge of thy ways.

021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
        profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
        is far from me.

021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
        cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows
        in his anger.

021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the
        storm carrieth away.

021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
        and he shall know it.

021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
        wrath of the Almighty.

021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
        number of his months is cut off in the midst?

021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
        are high.

021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and
        quiet.

021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
        marrow.

021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
        eateth with pleasure.

021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall
        cover them.

021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
        wrongfully imagine against me.

021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are
        the dwelling places of the wicked?

021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know
        their tokens,

021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
        shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
        what he hath done?

021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the
        tomb.

021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
        shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
        remaineth falsehood?

022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
        profitable unto himself?

022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
        or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee
        into judgment?

022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
        stripped the naked of their clothing.

022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
        withholden bread from the hungry.

022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the
        honourable man dwelt in it.

022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
        fatherless have been broken.

022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear
        troubleth thee;

022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
        cover thee.

022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
        the stars, how high they are!

022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the
        dark cloud?

022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
        walketh in the circuit of heaven.

022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was
        overflown with a flood:

022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty
        do for them?

022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel
        of the wicked is far from me.

022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh
        them to scorn.

022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
        the fire consumeth.

022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
        shall come unto thee.

022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
        words in thine heart.

022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
        shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
        the stones of the brooks.

022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
        plenty of silver.

022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and
        shalt lift up thy face unto God.

022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
        and thou shalt pay thy vows.

022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
        unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
        up; and he shall save the humble person.

022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is
        delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

023:001 Then Job answered and said,

023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
        my groaning.

023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
        to his seat!

023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
        arguments.

023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and
        understand what he would say unto me.

023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
        would put strength in me.

023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
        delivered for ever from my judge.

023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
        cannot perceive him:

023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
        he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
        shall come forth as gold.

023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
        declined.

023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
        have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
        food.

023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
        desireth, even that he doeth.

023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
        such things are with him.

023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
        afraid of him.

023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
        covered the darkness from my face.

024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
        that know him not see his days?

024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
        and feed thereof.

024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
        widow's ox for a pledge.

024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
        themselves together.

024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
        work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
        for them and for their children.

024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
        vintage of the wicked.

024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
        no covering in the cold.

024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
        the rock for want of a shelter.

024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
        of the poor.

024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
        away the sheaf from the hungry;

024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their
        winepresses, and suffer thirst.

024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
        crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
        the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
        and in the night is as a thief.

024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
        saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
        themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
        know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
        earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
        those which have sinned.

024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
        he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken
        as a tree.

024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
        good to the widow.

024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and
        no man is sure of life.

024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
        yet his eyes are upon their ways.

024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
        low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off
        as the tops of the ears of corn.

024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
        speech nothing worth?

025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high
        places.

025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
        light arise?

025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
        that is born of a woman?

025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
        are not pure in his sight.

025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which
        is a worm?

026:001 But Job answered and said,

026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
        thou the arm that hath no strength?

026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
        thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from
        thee?

026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the
        inhabitants thereof.

026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth
        the earth upon nothing.

026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
        not rent under them.

026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his
        cloud upon it.

026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
        night come to an end.

026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his
        reproof.

026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
        he smiteth through the proud.

026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
        formed the crooked serpent.

026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
        heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
        Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in
        my nostrils;

027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter
        deceit.

027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
        remove mine integrity from me.

027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
        shall not reproach me so long as I live.

027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against
        me as the unrighteous.

027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
        when God taketh away his soul?

027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call
        upon God?

027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the
        Almighty will I not conceal.

027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
        altogether vain?

027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
        of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
        offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
        widows shall not weep.

027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as
        the clay;

027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
        innocent shall divide the silver.

027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the
        keeper maketh.

027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
        openeth his eyes, and he is not.

027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him
        away in the night.

027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
        storm hurleth him out of his place.

027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
        out of his hand.

027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
        his place.

028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
        where they fine it.

028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
        stone.

028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all
        perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
        forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away
        from men.

028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
        turned up as it were fire.

028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
        of gold.

028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's
        eye hath not seen:

028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
        passed by it.

028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
        mountains by the roots.

028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
        precious thing.

028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
        hid bringeth he forth to light.

028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the
        land of the living.

028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
        with me.

028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
        for the price thereof.

028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
        onyx, or the sapphire.

028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of
        it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
        of wisdom is above rubies.

028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
        valued with pure gold.

028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close
        from the fowls of the air.

028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
        our ears.

028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
        thereof.

028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
        whole heaven;

028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
        by measure.

028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the
        lightning of the thunder:

028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
        searched it out.

028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
        wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
        preserved me;

029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I
        walked through darkness;

029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was
        upon my tabernacle;

029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about
        me;

029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out
        rivers of oil;

029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared
        my seat in the street!

029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
        and stood up.

029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
        mouth.

029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
        roof of their mouth.

029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
        saw me, it gave witness to me:

029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
        and him that had none to help him.

029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and
        I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as
        a robe and a diadem.

029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
        searched out.

029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
        of his teeth.

029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
        days as the sand.

029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
        night upon my branch.

029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
        counsel.

029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
        upon them.

029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
        mouth wide as for the latter rain.

029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of
        my countenance they cast not down.

029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in
        the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
        whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
        of my flock.

030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in
        whom old age was perished?

030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the
        wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
        meat.

030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them
        as after a thief;)

030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,
        and in the rocks.

030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
        gathered together.

030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
        were viler than the earth.

030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
        my face.

030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
        also let loose the bridle before me.

030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
        they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
        helper.

030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
        desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
        and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
        have taken hold upon me.

030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
        take no rest.

030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
        bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
        ashes.

030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
        thou regardest me not.

030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
        opposest thyself against me.

030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon
        it, and dissolvest my substance.

030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
        appointed for all living.

030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
        they cry in his destruction.

030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
        grieved for the poor?

030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I
        waited for light, there came darkness.

030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
        prevented me.

030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in
        the congregation.

030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the
        voice of them that weep.

031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
        a maid?

031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
        inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
        the workers of iniquity?

031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
        deceit;

031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
        integrity.

031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
        after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
        rooted out.

031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
        wait at my neighbour's door;

031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
        upon her.

031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
        punished by the judges.

031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
        out all mine increase.

031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
        maidservant, when they contended with me;

031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
        what shall I answer him?

031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
        fashion us in the womb?

031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
        the eyes of the widow to fail;

031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
        not eaten thereof;

031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a
        father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
        without covering;

031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
        with the fleece of my sheep;

031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
        my help in the gate:

031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
        broken from the bone.

031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
        his highness I could not endure.

031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
        Thou art my confidence;

031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine
        hand had gotten much;

031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
        brightness;

031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
        kissed my hand:

031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
        should have denied the God that is above.

031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or
        lifted up myself when evil found him:

031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
        his soul.

031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
        flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my
        doors to the traveller.

031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
        iniquity in my bosom:

031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
        terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
        Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written
        a book.

031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a
        crown to me.

031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
        would I go near unto him.

031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
        thereof complain;

031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
        caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
        barley. The words of Job are ended.

032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
        righteous in his own eyes.

032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
        Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath
        kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
        they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were
        elder than he.

032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
        three men, then his wrath was kindled.

032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
        am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and
        durst not shew you mine opinion.

032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
        wisdom.

032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
        Almighty giveth them understanding.

032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
        judgment.

032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
        whilst ye searched out what to say.

032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
        that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
        him down, not man.

032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
        answer him with your speeches.

032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off
        speaking.

032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
        answered no more;)

032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
        burst like new bottles.

032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
        answer.

032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
        me give flattering titles unto man.

032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
        would soon take me away.

033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to
        all my words.

033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
        my mouth.

033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
        shall utter knowledge clearly.

033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
        hath given me life.

033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,
        stand up.

033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
        formed out of the clay.

033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
        hand be heavy upon thee.

033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
        voice of thy words, saying,

033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is
        there iniquity in me.

033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for
        his enemy,

033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
        God is greater than man.

033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
        any of his matters.

033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
        upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
        instruction,

033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
        man.

033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
        perishing by the sword.

033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
        of his bones with strong pain:

033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
        bones that were not seen stick out.

033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
        destroyers.

033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
        thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
        going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to
        the days of his youth:

033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
        and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto
        man his righteousness.

033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
        perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
        shall see the light.

033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with
        the light of the living.

033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
        speak.

033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire
        to justify thee.

033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach
        thee wisdom.

034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that
        have knowledge.

034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
        is good.

034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
        judgment.

034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
        transgression.

034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
        walketh with wicked men.

034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
        delight himself with God.

034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
        from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,
        that he should commit iniquity.

034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
        every man to find according to his ways.

034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
        Almighty pervert judgment.

034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
        disposed the whole world?

034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his
        spirit and his breath;

034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
        dust.

034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the
        voice of my words.

034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
        him that is most just?

034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,
        Ye are ungodly?

034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of
        princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they
        all are the work of his hands.

034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
        at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
        without hand.

034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
        goings.

034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
        of iniquity may hide themselves.

034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
        enter into judgment with God.

034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
        others in their stead.

034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in
        the night, so that they are destroyed.

034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any
        of his ways:

034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
        he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when
        he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
        done against a nation, or against a man only:

034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
        chastisement, I will not offend any more:

034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
        will do no more.

034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
        whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
        therefore speak what thou knowest.

034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
        unto me.

034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
        wisdom.

034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
        answers for wicked men.

034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
        among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,

035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My
        righteousness is more than God's?

035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,
        What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which
        are higher than thou.

035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
        transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth
        he of thine hand?

035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
        righteousness may profit the son of man.

035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
        oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
        mighty.

035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
        night;

035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh
        us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
        of evil men.

035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
        regard it.

035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
        before him; therefore trust thou in him.

035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
        yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth
        words without knowledge.

036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,

036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to
        speak on God's behalf.

036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
        righteousness to my Maker.

036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
        knowledge is with thee.

036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
        strength and wisdom.

036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to
        the poor.

036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
        are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,
        and they are exalted.

036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
        affliction;

036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that
        they have exceeded.

036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
        they return from iniquity.

036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
        prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
        shall die without knowledge.

036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
        he bindeth them.

036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their
        ears in oppression.

036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
        broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
        should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
        and justice take hold on thee.

036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
        stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
        strength.

036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
        rather than affliction.

036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
        wrought iniquity?

036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
        number of his years be searched out.

036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
        according to the vapour thereof:

036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
        noise of his tabernacle?

036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
        bottom of the sea.

036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
        abundance.

036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
        shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
        concerning the vapour.

037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
        place.

037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that
        goeth out of his mouth.

037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
        the ends of the earth.

037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
        excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
        he, which we cannot comprehend.

037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to
        the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
        work.

037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the
        north.

037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
        waters is straitened.

037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
        his bright cloud:

037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
        whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in
        the earth.

037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his
        land, or for mercy.

037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
        wondrous works of God.

037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
        his cloud to shine?

037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
        works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
        south wind?

037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as
        a molten looking glass?

037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our
        speech by reason of darkness.

037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
        shall be swallowed up.

037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
        but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
        majesty.

037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
        in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
        not afflict.

037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
        of heart.

038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,
        and answer thou me.

038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
        declare, if thou hast understanding.

038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who
        hath stretched the line upon it?

038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid
        the corner stone thereof;

038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
        shouted for joy?

038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if
        it had issued out of the womb?

038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
        a swaddlingband for it,

038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here
        shall thy proud waves be stayed?

038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
        dayspring to know his place;

038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the
        wicked might be shaken out of it?

038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high
        arm shall be broken.

038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
        walked in the search of the depth?

038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou
        seen the doors of the shadow of death?

038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
        knowest it all.

038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
        where is the place thereof,

038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that
        thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
        number of thy days is great?

038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
        seen the treasures of the hail,

038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the
        day of battle and war?

038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east
        wind upon the earth?

038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
        or a way for the lightning of thunder;

038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
        wilderness, wherein there is no man;

038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
        of the tender herb to spring forth?

038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,
        who hath gendered it?

038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep
        is frozen.

038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
        bands of Orion?

038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
        guide Arcturus with his sons?

038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
        dominion thereof in the earth?

038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
        waters may cover thee?

038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto
        thee, Here we are?

038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
        understanding to the heart?

038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
        bottles of heaven,

038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
        together?

038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of
        the young lions,

038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie
        in wait?

038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry
        unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
        forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou
        the time when they bring forth?

039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they
        cast out their sorrows.

039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
        they go forth, and return not unto them.

039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the
        bands of the wild ass?

039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land
        his dwellings.

039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
        the crying of the driver.

039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
        after every green thing.

039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy
        crib?

039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or
        will he harrow the valleys after thee?

039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt
        thou leave thy labour to him?

039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and
        gather it into thy barn?

039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
        feathers unto the ostrich?

039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
        beast may break them.

039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were
        not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
        imparted to her understanding.

039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
        horse and his rider.

039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
        with thunder?

039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
        nostrils is terrible.

039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
        goeth on to meet the armed men.

039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
        back from the sword.

039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
        shield.

039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
        believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
        battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
        shouting.

039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
        the south?

039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on
        high?

039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the
        rock, and the strong place.

039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar
        off.

039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
        there is she.

040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he
        that reproveth God, let him answer it.

040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
        hand upon my mouth.

040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
        will proceed no further.

040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
        said,

040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
        declare thou unto me.

040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
        that thou mayest be righteous?

040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
        like him?

040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
        thyself with glory and beauty.

040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that
        is proud, and abase him.

040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
        down the wicked in their place.

040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in
        secret.

040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
        can save thee.

040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
        as an ox.

040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
        navel of his belly.

040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
        wrapped together.

040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like
        bars of iron.

040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
        his sword to approach unto him.

040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
        beasts of the field play.

040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
        fens.

040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of
        the brook compass him about.

040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
        that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with
        a cord which thou lettest down?

041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
        with a thorn?

041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
        words unto thee?

041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
        servant for ever?

041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him
        for thy maidens?

041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
        him among the merchants?

041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
        fish spears?

041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
        even at the sight of him?

041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
        stand before me?

041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
        under the whole heaven is mine.

041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
        proportion.

041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to
        him with his double bridle?

041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible
        round about.

041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
        seal.

041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
        cannot be sundered.

041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
        eyelids of the morning.

041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap
        out.

041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
        caldron.

041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
        before him.

041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
        themselves; they cannot be moved.

041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
        the nether millstone.

041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
        of breakings they purify themselves.

041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
        the dart, nor the habergeon.

041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
        him into stubble.

041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
        spear.

041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
        upon the mire.

041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like
        a pot of ointment.

041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
        to be hoary.

041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the
        children of pride.

042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can
        be withholden from thee.

042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
        have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
        me, which I knew not.

042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
        and declare thou unto me.

042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
        eye seeth thee.

042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
        Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
        kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
        not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
        hath.

042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and
        go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
        offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
        I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye
        have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my
        servant Job.

042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
        Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
        the LORD also accepted Job.

042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
        his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had
        before.

042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
        sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
        before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
        bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
        LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
        money, and every one an earring of gold.

042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
        beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
        thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
        she asses.

042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.

042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of
        the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the
        daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
        their brethren.

042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
        sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19	Psalms

001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
        ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
        the seat of the scornful.

001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
        he meditate day and night.

001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
        that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
        shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
        driveth away.

001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
        sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
        the ungodly shall perish.

002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
        counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
        saying,

002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
        from us.

002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
        have them in derision.

002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
        his sore displeasure.

002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
        art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
        inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
        possession.

002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
        in pieces like a potter's vessel.

002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
        the earth.

002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
        when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
        that put their trust in him.

003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
        that rise up against me.

003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
        in God. Selah.

003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
        lifter up of mine head.

003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
        his holy hill. Selah.

003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
        themselves against me round about.

003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
        mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
        of the ungodly.

003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
        people. Selah.

004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
        enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
        hear my prayer.

004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
        how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
        himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
        your bed, and be still. Selah.

004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
        the LORD.

004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
        thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
        their corn and their wine increased.

004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
        only makest me dwell in safety.

005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
        unto thee will I pray.

005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
        morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
        neither shall evil dwell with thee.

005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
        workers of iniquity.

005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
        abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
        thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
        temple.

005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
        make thy way straight before my face.

005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
        is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
        flatter with their tongue.

005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
        cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
        they have rebelled against thee.

005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
        them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
        also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
        thou compass him as with a shield.

006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
        thy hot displeasure.

006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
        for my bones are vexed.

006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
        sake.

006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
        shall give thee thanks?

006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
        swim; I water my couch with my tears.

006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
        of all mine enemies.

006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
        heard the voice of my weeping.

006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
        prayer.

006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
        return and be ashamed suddenly.

007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
        them that persecute me, and deliver me:

007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
        there is none to deliver.

007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
        hands;

007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
        (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
        tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
        dust. Selah.

007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
        rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
        thou hast commanded.

007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
        for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
        to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
        in me.

007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
        establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
        and reins.

007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
        every day.

007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
        and made it ready.

007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
        ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
        mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
        which he made.

007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
        dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
        will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
        who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
        strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
        the enemy and the avenger.

008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
        and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
        that thou visitest him?

008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
        hast crowned him with glory and honour.

008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
        thou hast put all things under his feet:

008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
        passeth through the paths of the seas.

008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
        forth all thy marvellous works.

009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
        name, O thou most High.

009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
        at thy presence.

009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
        the throne judging right.

009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
        thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
        thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
        them.

009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
        throne for judgment.

009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
        minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
        times of trouble.

009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
        thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
        among the people his doings.

009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
        forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
        of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
        of death:

009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
        daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
        net which they hid is their own foot taken.

009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
        wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
        Selah.

009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
        forget God.

009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
        the poor shall not perish for ever.

009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
        in thy sight.

009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
        to be but men. Selah.

010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
        times of trouble?

010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
        taken in the devices that they have imagined.

010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
        the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
        seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
        of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
        never be in adversity.

010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
        tongue is mischief and vanity.

010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
        secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
        privily set against the poor.

010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
        wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
        draweth him into his net.

010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
        his strong ones.

010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
        face; he will never see it.

010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
        humble.

010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
        heart, Thou wilt not require it.

010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
        requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
        thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
        his wickedness till thou find none.

010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
        out of his land.

010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
        prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
        earth may no more oppress.

011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
        bird to your mountain?

011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
        arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
        upright in heart.

011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
        heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
        loveth violence his soul hateth.

011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
        an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
        doth behold the upright.

012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
        from among the children of men.

012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
        flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
        that speaketh proud things:

012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
        our own: who is lord over us?

012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
        now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
        from him that puffeth at him.

012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
        furnace of earth, purified seven times.

012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
        this generation for ever.

012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
        exalted.

013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
        thou hide thy face from me?

013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
        heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
        sleep the sleep of death;

013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
        that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
        salvation.

013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
        with me.

014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
        corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
        doeth good.

014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
        see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
        there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
        the righteous.

014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
        his refuge.

014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
        the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
        shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
        thy holy hill?

015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
        speaketh the truth in his heart.

015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
        neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
        them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
        changeth not.

015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
        against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
        be moved.

016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
        goodness extendeth not to thee;

016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
        in whom is all my delight.

016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
        god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
        up their names into my lips.

016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
        thou maintainest my lot.

016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
        goodly heritage.

016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
        also instruct me in the night seasons.

016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
        right hand, I shall not be moved.

016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
        also shall rest in hope.

016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
        suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
        of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
        prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
        behold the things that are equal.

017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
        night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
        purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
        kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
        thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
        right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
        rise up against them.

017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
        thy wings,

017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
        compass me about.

017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
        speak proudly.

017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
        eyes bowing down to the earth;

017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
        young lion lurking in secret places.

017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
        from the wicked, which is thy sword:

017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
        which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
        fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
        leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
        satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
        God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
        horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
        shall I be saved from mine enemies.

018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid.

018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
        prevented me.

018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
        he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
        him, even into his ears.

018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
        hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
        under his feet.

018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
        the wings of the wind.

018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
        him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
        hail stones and coals of fire.

018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
        his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
        out lightnings, and discomfited them.

018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
        the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
        of the breath of thy nostrils.

018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
        hated me: for they were too strong for me.

018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
        his statutes from me.

018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
        righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
        eyesight.

018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
        upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
        high looks.

018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
        my darkness.

018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
        perfect.

018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
        high places.

018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
        great.

018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
        slip.

018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
        turn again till they were consumed.

018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
        fallen under my feet.

018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
        hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
        LORD, but he answered them not.

018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
        cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
        thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
        have not known shall serve me.

018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
        shall submit themselves unto me.

018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
        close places.

018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
        salvation be exalted.

018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
        above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
        from the violent man.

018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
        his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
        sheweth his handywork.

019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
        knowledge.

019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
        heard.

019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
        to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
        the sun,

019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
        rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
        unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
        thereof.

019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
        testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
        commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
        judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
        gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
        there is great reward.

019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
        faults.

019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
        not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
        shall be innocent from the great transgression.

019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
        acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
        of Jacob defend thee;

020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
        Zion;

020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
        Selah.

020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
        counsel.

020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
        we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
        from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
        hand.

020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
        remember the name of the LORD our God.

020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
        upright.

020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
        salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
        withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
        settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
        days for ever and ever.

021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
        thou laid upon him.

021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
        him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
        the most High he shall not be moved.

021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
        shall find out those that hate thee.

021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
        anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
        fire shall devour them.

021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
        from among the children of men.

021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
        mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
        shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
        face of them.

021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
        and praise thy power.

022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
        from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
        the night season, and am not silent.

022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
        Israel.

022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
        deliver them.

022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
        thee, and were not confounded.

022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
        of the people.

022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
        lip, they shake the head, saying,

022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
        deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
        me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
        mother's belly.

022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
        help.

022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
        beset me round.

022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
        roaring lion.

022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
        my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
        cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
        death.

022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
        inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
        vesture.

022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
        to help me.

022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
        the dog.

022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
        horns of the unicorns.

022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
        congregation will I praise thee.

022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
        glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
        afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
        cried unto him, he heard.

022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
        pay my vows before them that fear him.

022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
        LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
        LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
        thee.

022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
        the nations.

022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
        they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
        can keep alive his own soul.

022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
        a generation.

022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
        people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
        beside the still waters.

023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
        righteousness for his name's sake.

023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
        I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
        staff they comfort me.

023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
        enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
        life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
        and they that dwell therein.

024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
        the floods.

024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
        in his holy place?

024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
        lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
        from the God of his salvation.

024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
        face, O Jacob. Selah.

024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
        LORD mighty in battle.

024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
        of glory. Selah.

025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
        enemies triumph over me.

025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
        ashamed which transgress without cause.

025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
        salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
        for they have been ever of old.

025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
        according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
        sake, O LORD.

025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
        in the way.

025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
        his way.

025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
        keep his covenant and his testimonies.

025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
        great.

025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
        the way that he shall choose.

025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
        earth.

025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
        shew them his covenant.

025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
        out of the net.

025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
        and afflicted.

025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
        my distresses.

025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
        sins.

025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
        with cruel hatred.

025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
        put my trust in thee.

025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
        trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
        in thy truth.

026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
        dissemblers.

026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
        with the wicked.

026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
        altar, O LORD:

026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
        all thy wondrous works.

026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
        where thine honour dwelleth.

026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
        bribes.

026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
        be merciful unto me.

026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
        bless the LORD.

027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
        LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
        to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
        fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
        confident.

027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
        that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
        life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
        temple.

027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
        in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
        me up upon a rock.

027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
        about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
        of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
        me, and answer me.

027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
        Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
        anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
        me, O God of my salvation.

027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
        take me up.

027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
        of mine enemies.

027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
        witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
        cruelty.

027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
        the LORD in the land of the living.

027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
        thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
        lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
        into the pit.

028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
        I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
        iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
        is in their hearts.

028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
        wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
        their hands; render to them their desert.

028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
        operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
        them up.

028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
        supplications.

028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
        him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
        and with my song will I praise him.

028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
        his anointed.

028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
        and lift them up for ever.

029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
        strength.

029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
        LORD in the beauty of holiness.

029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
        thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
        full of majesty.

029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
        breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
        like a young unicorn.

029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
        the wilderness of Kadesh.

029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
        discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
        speak of his glory.

029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
        for ever.

029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
        bless his people with peace.

030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
        hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
        kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
        weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
        strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
        supplication.

030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
        Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
        put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
        silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
        deliver me in thy righteousness.

031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
        strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
        sake lead me, and guide me.

031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
        thou art my strength.

031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
        LORD God of truth.

031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
        the LORD.

031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
        considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
        set my feet in a large room.

031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
        consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
        strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
        consumed.

031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
        my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
        see me without fled from me.

031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
        vessel.

031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
        while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
        take away my life.

031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
        enemies, and from them that persecute me.

031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
        mercies' sake.

031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
        let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
        grave.

031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
        things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
        that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
        thee before the sons of men!

031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
        pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
        the strife of tongues.

031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
        kindness in a strong city.

031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
        nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
        I cried unto thee.

031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
        the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
        that hope in the LORD.

032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
        covered.

032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
        and in whose spirit there is no guile.

032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
        the day long.

032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
        turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
        hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
        and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
        time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
        waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
        thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
        shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
        understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
        bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
        the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
        joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
        the upright.

033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings.

033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
        in truth.

033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
        goodness of the LORD.

033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
        host of them by the breath of his mouth.

033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
        layeth up the depth in storehouses.

033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
        the world stand in awe of him.

033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
        fast.

033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
        maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
        heart to all generations.

033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
        whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
        men.

033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
        inhabitants of the earth.

033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
        works.

033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
        man is not delivered by much strength.

033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
        any by his great strength.

033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
        them that hope in his mercy;

033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
        famine.

033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
        his holy name.

033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
        thee.

034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
        continually be in my mouth.

034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
        hear thereof, and be glad.

034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
        together.

034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
        my fears.

034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
        not ashamed.

034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
        of all his troubles.

034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
        him, and delivereth them.

034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
        trusteth in him.

034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
        that fear him.

034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
        the LORD shall not want any good thing.

034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
        of the LORD.

034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
        he may see good?

034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
        open unto their cry.

034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
        the remembrance of them from the earth.

034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
        out of all their troubles.

034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
        saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
        delivereth him out of them all.

034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
        shall be desolate.

034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
        that trust in him shall be desolate.

035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
        against them that fight against me.

035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
        persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
        soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
        devise my hurt.

035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
        LORD chase them.

035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
        LORD persecute them.

035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
        which without cause they have digged for my soul.

035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
        that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
        him fall.

035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
        his salvation.

035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
        deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
        the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
        that I knew not.

035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
        I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
        mine own bosom.

035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
        bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
        together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
        against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
        not:

035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
        their teeth.

035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
        destructions, my darling from the lions.

035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
        praise thee among much people.

035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
        neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
        cause.

035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
        against them that are quiet in the land.

035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
        aha, our eye hath seen it.

035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
        far from me.

035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
        my God and my Lord.

035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
        let them not rejoice over me.

035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
        them not say, We have swallowed him up.

035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
        rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
        dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
        cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
        magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
        servant.

035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
        praise all the day long.

036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
        there is no fear of God before his eyes.

036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
        be found to be hateful.

036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
        off to be wise, and to do good.

036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
        that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
        reacheth unto the clouds.

036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
        are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
        children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
        house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
        pleasures.

036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
        see light.

036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
        thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
        hand of the wicked remove me.

036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
        and shall not be able to rise.

037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
        against the workers of iniquity.

037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
        the green herb.

037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
        land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
        desires of thine heart.

037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
        bring it to pass.

037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
        thy judgment as the noonday.

037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
        because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
        who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
        wise to do evil.

037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
        LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
        shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
        themselves in the abundance of peace.

037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
        with his teeth.

037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
        coming.

037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
        to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
        upright conversation.

037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
        shall be broken.

037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
        of many wicked.

037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
        upholdeth the righteous.

037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
        inheritance shall be for ever.

037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
        famine they shall be satisfied.

037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
        be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
        they consume away.

037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
        sheweth mercy, and giveth.

037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
        they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
        delighteth in his way.

037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
        LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
        righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
        they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
        be cut off.

037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
        ever.

037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
        talketh of judgment.

037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
        slide.

037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
        he is judged.

037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
        inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
        it.

037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
        like a green bay tree.

037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
        but he could not be found.

037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
        that man is peace.

037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
        the wicked shall be cut off.

037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
        strength in the time of trouble.

037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
        deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
        trust in him.

038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
        hot displeasure.

038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
        sore.

038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
        neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
        burden they are too heavy for me.

038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
        day long.

038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
        no soundness in my flesh.

038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
        disquietness of my heart.

038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
        from thee.

038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
        mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
        kinsmen stand afar off.

038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
        that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
        deceits all the day long.

038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
        openeth not his mouth.

038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
        no reproofs.

038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
        me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
        me.

038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
        that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
        because I follow the thing that good is.

038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
        tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
        is before me.

039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
        my sorrow was stirred.

039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
        burned: then spake I with my tongue,

039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
        what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
        is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
        is altogether vanity. Selah.

039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
        disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
        shall gather them.

039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
        reproach of the foolish.

039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
        thine hand.

039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
        makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
        man is vanity. Selah.

039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
        peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
        sojourner, as all my fathers were.

039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
        and be no more.

040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
        heard my cry.

040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
        clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
        God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
        respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
        done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
        reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
        of them, they are more than can be numbered.

040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
        thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
        required.

040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
        written of me,
040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
        heart.

040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
        have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
        declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
        concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
        congregation.

040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
        lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
        have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
        they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
        faileth me.

040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
        me.

040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
        soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
        shame that wish me evil.

040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
        me, Aha, aha.

040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
        such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
        magnified.

040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
        art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
        him in time of trouble.

041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
        be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
        the will of his enemies.

041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
        wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
        sinned against thee.

041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
        perish?

041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
        gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
        it.

041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
        they devise my hurt.

041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
        that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
        eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
        may requite them.

041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
        not triumph over me.

041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
        settest me before thy face for ever.

041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
        everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
        after thee, O God.

042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
        come and appear before God?

042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
        continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
        had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
        God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
        kept holyday.

042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
        help of his countenance.

042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
        remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
        from the hill Mizar.

042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
        thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
        and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
        the God of my life.

042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
        go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
        they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
        is the health of my countenance, and my God.

043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
        O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
        off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
        bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
        joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
        health of my countenance, and my God.

044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
        what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
        plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
        them out.

044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
        neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
        thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
        hadst a favour unto them.

044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
        will we tread them under that rise up against us.

044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
        me.

044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
        shame that hated us.

044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
        ever. Selah.

044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
        forth with our armies.

044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
        hate us spoil for themselves.

044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
        scattered us among the heathen.

044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
        wealth by their price.

044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
        derision to them that are round about us.

044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
        head among the people.

044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
        face hath covered me,

044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
        reason of the enemy and avenger.

044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
        neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
        from thy way;

044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
        covered us with the shadow of death.

044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
        hands to a strange god;

044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
        the heart.

044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
        counted as sheep for the slaughter.

044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
        ever.

044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
        and our oppression?

044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
        unto the earth.

044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
        which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
        ready writer.

045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
        thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
        and thy majesty.

045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
        meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
        thee terrible things.

045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
        whereby the people fall under thee.

045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
        kingdom is a right sceptre.

045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
        God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows.

045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
        the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
        right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
        forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
        Lord; and worship thou him.

045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
        rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
        wrought gold.

045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
        the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
        unto thee.

045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
        enter into the king's palace.

045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
        make princes in all the earth.

045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
        therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
        trouble.

046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
        though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
        mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
        of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
        help her, and that right early.

046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
        voice, the earth melted.

046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
        made in the earth.

046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
        the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
        chariot in the fire.

046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
        heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
        voice of triumph.

047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
        all the earth.

047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
        feet.

047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
        Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
        trumpet.

047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
        sing praises.

047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
        understanding.

047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
        his holiness.

047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
        people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
        belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
        our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
        Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
        hasted away.

048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
        travail.

048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
        hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
        Selah.

048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
        thy temple.

048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
        of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
        because of thy judgments.

048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
        thereof.

048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
        tell it to the generation following.

048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
        guide even unto death.

049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        world:

049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
        shall be of understanding.

049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
        saying upon the harp.

049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
        of my heels shall compass me about?

049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
        multitude of their riches;

049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
        God a ransom for him:

049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
        for ever:)

049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
        brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
        ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
        their lands after their own names.

049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
        beasts that perish.

049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
        their sayings. Selah.

049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
        them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
        morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
        their dwelling.

049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
        he shall receive me. Selah.

049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
        his house is increased;

049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
        not descend after him.

049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
        thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
        see light.

049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
        beasts that perish.

050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
        earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
        devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
        about him.

050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
        that he may judge his people.

050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
        covenant with me by sacrifice.

050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
        judge himself. Selah.

050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
        testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
        offerings, to have been continually before me.

050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
        thy folds.

050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
        thousand hills.

050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
        the field are mine.

050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
        mine, and the fulness thereof.

050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
        High:

050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
        and thou shalt glorify me.

050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
        my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
        mouth?

050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
        thee.

050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
        hast been partaker with adulterers.

050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
        thine own mother's son.

050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
        thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
        will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
        pieces, and there be none to deliver.

050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
        his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
        according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
        transgressions.

051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
        sin.

051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
        me.

051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
        thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
        and be clear when thou judgest.

051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
        conceive me.

051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
        hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
        shall be whiter than snow.

051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
        hast broken may rejoice.

051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
        within me.

051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
        spirit from me.

051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
        thy free spirit.

051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
        converted unto thee.

051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
        salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
        righteousness.

051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
        praise.

051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
        delightest not in burnt offering.

051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
        contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
        of Jerusalem.

051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
        righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
        then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
        goodness of God endureth continually.

052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
        deceitfully.

052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
        speak righteousness. Selah.

052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
        away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
        out of the land of the living. Selah.

052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
        him:

052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
        trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
        himself in his wickedness.

052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
        in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
        will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
        they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
        doeth good.

053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
        if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
        filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
        scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
        hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
        God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
        rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
        after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
        my soul.

054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
        truth.

054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
        LORD; for it is good.

054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
        seen his desire upon mine enemies.

055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
        supplication.

055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
        a noise;

055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
        of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
        they hate me.

055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
        are fallen upon me.

055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
        overwhelmed me.

055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
        fly away, and be at rest.

055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
        Selah.

055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
        violence and strife in the city.

055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
        mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
        not from her streets.

055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
        borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
        himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
        acquaintance.

055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
        God in company.

055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
        hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
        and he shall hear my voice.

055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
        against me: for there were many with me.

055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
        Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
        God.

055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
        him: he hath broken his covenant.

055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
        in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
        drawn swords.

055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
        shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
        destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
        their days; but I will trust in thee.

056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
        fighting daily oppresseth me.

056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
        fight against me, O thou most High.

056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
        will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
        me for evil.

056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
        mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
        people, O God.

056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
        are they not in thy book?

056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
        I know; for God is for me.

056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
        word.

056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
        do unto me.

056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
        deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
        the light of the living?

057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
        trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
        my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
        things for me.

057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
        him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
        mercy and his truth.

057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
        on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
        arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
        they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
        are fallen themselves. Selah.

057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
        give praise.

057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
        awake early.

057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
        thee among the nations.

057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
        the clouds.

057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
        uprightly, O ye sons of men?

058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
        your hands in the earth.

058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
        as they be born, speaking lies.

058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
        the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
        never so wisely.

058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
        teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
        bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
        pieces.

058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
        like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
        sun.

058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
        as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
        shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
        righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
        that rise up against me.

059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
        bloody men.

059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
        against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
        help me, and behold.

059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
        to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
        transgressors. Selah.

059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
        round about the city.

059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
        lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
        heathen in derision.

059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
        defence.

059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
        desire upon mine enemies.

059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
        power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
        them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
        which they speak.

059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
        let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
        earth. Selah.

059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
        a dog, and go round about the city.

059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
        not satisfied.

059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
        mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
        in the day of my trouble.

059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
        and the God of my mercy.

060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
        hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
        the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
        drink the wine of astonishment.

060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
        be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
        and hear me.

060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
        strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
        Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
        God, which didst not go out with our armies?

060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
        is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
        the enemy.

061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
        covert of thy wings. Selah.

061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
        heritage of those that fear thy name.

061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
        generations.

061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
        which may preserve him.

061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
        perform my vows.

062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
        not be greatly moved.

062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
        slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
        tottering fence.

062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
        delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
        inwardly. Selah.

062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
        him.

062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
        not be moved.

062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
        and my refuge, is in God.

062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
        before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
        are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
        lighter than vanity.

062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
        riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
        belongeth unto God.

062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
        every man according to his work.

063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
        thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
        thirsty land, where no water is;

063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
        sanctuary.

063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
        praise thee.

063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
        in thy name.

063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
        mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
        night watches.

063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
        wings will I rejoice.

063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
        me.

063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
        lower parts of the earth.

063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
        foxes.

063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
        him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
        be stopped.

064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
        of the enemy.

064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
        insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
        shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
        shoot at him, and fear not.

064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
        laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
        both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
        is deep.

064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
        be wounded.

064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
        all that see them shall flee away.

064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
        they shall wisely consider of his doing.

064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
        him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
        the vow be performed.

065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
        shalt purge them away.

065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
        unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
        satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
        temple.

065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
        of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
        the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
        with power:

065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
        waves, and the tumult of the people.

065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
        tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
        to rejoice.

065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
        enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
        thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
        furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
        blessest the springing thereof.

065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
        fatness.

065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
        hills rejoice on every side.

065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
        covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
        greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
        unto thee.

066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
        they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
        toward the children of men.

066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
        on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
        let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
        to be heard:

066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
        be moved.

066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
        is tried.

066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
        our loins.

066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
        fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
        wealthy place.

066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
        my vows,

066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
        was in trouble.

066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
        incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
        he hath done for my soul.

066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
        tongue.

066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
        my prayer.

066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
        mercy from me.

067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
        shine upon us; Selah.

067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
        all nations.

067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
        judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
        earth. Selah.

067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
        God, shall bless us.

067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
        him.

068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
        that hate him flee before him.

068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
        before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
        God.

068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
        yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
        upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
        in his holy habitation.

068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
        which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
        land.

068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
        didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
        God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
        God of Israel.

068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
        confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
        prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
        published it.

068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
        divided the spoil.

068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
        wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
        yellow gold.

068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
        in Salmon.

068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
        hill of Bashan.

068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
        desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
        angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
        place.

068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
        thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
        also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
        the God of our salvation. Selah.

068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
        Lord belong the issues from death.

068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
        scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
        people again from the depths of the sea:

068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
        the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
        my King, in the sanctuary.

068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
        after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
        fountain of Israel.

068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
        Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
        princes of Naphtali.

068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
        which thou hast wrought for us.

068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
        unto thee.

068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
        with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
        with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
        war.

068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
        out her hands unto God.

068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
        the Lord; Selah:

068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
        old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
        and his strength is in the clouds.

068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
        Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
        Blessed be God.

069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
        into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
        while I wait for my God.

069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
        mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
        wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
        away.

069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
        from thee.

069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
        ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
        confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
        my face.

069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
        mother's children.

069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
        reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
        my reproach.

069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
        them.

069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
        of the drunkards.

069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
        acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
        in the truth of thy salvation.

069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
        delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
        swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
        according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
        hear me speedily.

069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
        mine enemies.

069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
        mine adversaries are all before thee.

069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
        I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
        comforters, but I found none.

069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
        me vinegar to drink.

069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
        should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
        loins continually to shake.

069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
        anger take hold of them.

069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
        tents.

069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
        to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
        thy righteousness.

069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
        written with the righteous.

069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
        up on high.

069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
        him with thanksgiving.

069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
        that hath horns and hoofs.

069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
        live that seek God.

069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
        prisoners.

069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
        that moveth therein.

069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
        that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
        love his name shall dwell therein.

070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
        LORD.

070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
        let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
        my hurt.

070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
        Aha, aha.

070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
        let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
        magnified.

070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
        my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
        confusion.

071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
        incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
        resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
        my rock and my fortress.

071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
        the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
        youth.

071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
        took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
        continually of thee.

071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
        the day.

071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
        strength faileth.

071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
        my soul take counsel together,

071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
        there is none to deliver him.

071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
        soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
        seek my hurt.

071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
        more.

071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
        all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
        of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
        declared thy wondrous works.

071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
        until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
        power to every one that is to come.

071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
        great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
        quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
        of the earth.

071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
        side.

071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
        my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
        of Israel.

071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
        soul, which thou hast redeemed.

071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
        long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
        shame, that seek my hurt.

072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
        the king's son.

072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
        with judgment.

072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
        hills, by righteousness.

072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
        children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
        oppressor.

072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
        throughout all generations.

072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
        that water the earth.

072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
        peace so long as the moon endureth.

072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
        river unto the ends of the earth.

072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
        his enemies shall lick the dust.

072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
        the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
        serve him.

072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
        and him that hath no helper.

072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
        the needy.

072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
        precious shall their blood be in his sight.

072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
        Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
        daily shall he be praised.

072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
        the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
        they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
        long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
        shall call him blessed.

072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
        wondrous things.

072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
        earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
        heart.

073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
        nigh slipped.

073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
        the wicked.

073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
        firm.

073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
        like other men.

073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
        covereth them as a garment.

073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
        could wish.

073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
        they speak loftily.

073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
        walketh through the earth.

073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
        are wrung out to them.

073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
        most High?

073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
        increase in riches.

073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
        in innocency.

073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
        morning.

073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
        the generation of thy children.

073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
        their end.

073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
        them down into destruction.

073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
        utterly consumed with terrors.

073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
        thou shalt despise their image.

073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
        by my right hand.

073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
        to glory.

073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
        that I desire beside thee.

073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
        heart, and my portion for ever.

073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
        destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
        in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
        anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
        the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
        mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
        the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
        up their ensigns for signs.

074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
        thick trees.

074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
        axes and hammers.

074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
        casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
        have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
        there among us any that knoweth how long.

074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
        blaspheme thy name for ever?

074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
        out of thy bosom.

074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
        the earth.

074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
        heads of the dragons in the waters.

074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
        to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
        mighty rivers.

074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
        the light and the sun.

074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
        summer and winter.

074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
        that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
        the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
        earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
        praise thy name.

074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
        man reproacheth thee daily.

074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
        that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
        thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
        bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
        Lift not up the horn:

075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
        nor from the south.

075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
        another.

075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
        red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
        but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
        them out, and drink them.

075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
        Jacob.

075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
        of the righteous shall be exalted.

076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
        Zion.

076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
        sword, and the battle. Selah.

076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
        prey.

076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
        none of the men of might have found their hands.

076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
        cast into a dead sleep.

076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
        sight when once thou art angry?

076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
        feared, and was still,

076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
        Selah.

076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
        wrath shalt thou restrain.

076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
        about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
        kings of the earth.

077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
        and he gave ear unto me.

077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
        night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
        spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
        speak.

077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
        mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
        more?

077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
        evermore?

077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
        his tender mercies? Selah.

077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
        years of the right hand of the most High.

077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
        thy wonders of old.

077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
        our God?

077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
        strength among the people.

077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
        Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
        afraid: the depths also were troubled.

077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
        arrows also went abroad.

077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
        lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
        thy footsteps are not known.

077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
        Aaron.

078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
        words of my mouth.

078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
        of old:

078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
        generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
        and his wonderful works that he hath done.

078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
        in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
        make them known to their children:

078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
        which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
        their children:

078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
        works of God, but keep his commandments:

078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
        generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
        whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
        turned back in the day of battle.

078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
        law;

078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
        land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
        made the waters to stand as an heap.

078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
        night with a light of fire.

078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
        out of the great depths.

078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
        run down like rivers.

078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
        High in the wilderness.

078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
        lust.

078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
        table in the wilderness?

078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
        streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
        flesh for his people?

078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
        kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
        salvation:

078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
        doors of heaven,

078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
        of the corn of heaven.

078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
        he brought in the south wind.

078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
        like as the sand of the sea:

078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
        their habitations.

078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
        own desire;

078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
        was yet in their mouths,

078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
        and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
        wondrous works.

078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
        in trouble.

078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
        enquired early after God.

078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
        their redeemer.

078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
        lied unto him with their tongues.

078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
        stedfast in his covenant.

078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
        destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
        and did not stir up all his wrath.

078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
        passeth away, and cometh not again.

078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
        in the desert!

078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
        One of Israel.

078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
        them from the enemy.

078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
        field of Zoan.

078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
        they could not drink.

078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
        and frogs, which destroyed them.

078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
        labour unto the locust.

078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
        with frost.

078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
        hot thunderbolts.

078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
        indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
        death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
        strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
        them in the wilderness like a flock.

078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
        sea overwhelmed their enemies.

078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
        this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
        inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
        their tents.

078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
        his testimonies:

078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
        they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
        moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
        Israel:

078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
        placed among men;

078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
        the enemy's hand.

078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
        with his inheritance.

078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
        given to marriage.

078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
        lamentation.

078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
        man that shouteth by reason of wine.

078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
        perpetual reproach.

078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
        the tribe of Ephraim:

078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
        which he hath established for ever.

078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
        sheepfolds:

078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
        feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
        guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
        temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
        unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
        beasts of the earth.

079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
        and there was none to bury them.

079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
        derision to them that are round about us.

079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
        jealousy burn like fire?

079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
        and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
        place.

079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
        mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
        and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
        be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
        the blood of thy servants which is shed.

079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
        the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
        appointed to die;

079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
        their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
        thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
        generations.

080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
        a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
        forth.

080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
        and come and save us.

080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
        shall be saved.

080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
        prayer of thy people?

080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
        tears to drink in great measure.

080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
        laugh among themselves.

080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
        heathen, and planted it.

080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
        deep root, and it filled the land.

080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
        thereof were like the goodly cedars.

080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
        the river.

080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
        which pass by the way do pluck her?

080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
        the field doth devour it.

080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
        heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
        branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
        rebuke of thy countenance.

080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
        of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
        upon thy name.

080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
        God of Jacob.

081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
        with the psaltery.

081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
        our solemn feast day.

081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
        Jacob.

081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
        through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
        understood not.

081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
        delivered from the pots.

081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
        thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
        waters of Meribah. Selah.

081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
        thou wilt hearken unto me;

081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
        worship any strange god.

081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
        none of me.

081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
        in their own counsels.

081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
        in my ways!

081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
        against their adversaries.

081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
        him: but their time should have endured for ever.

081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
        with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
        among the gods.

082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
        wicked? Selah.

082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
        and needy.

082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
        wicked.

082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
        darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
        most High.

082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
        nations.

083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
        still, O God.

083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
        have lifted up the head.

083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
        consulted against thy hidden ones.

083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
        nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
        confederate against thee:

083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
        Hagarenes;

083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
        inhabitants of Tyre;

083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
        of Lot. Selah.

083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
        Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
        princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
        possession.

083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
        wind.

083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
        mountains on fire;

083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
        thy storm.

083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
        LORD.

083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
        put to shame, and perish:

083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
        the most high over all the earth.

084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
        LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
        for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
        LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
        praising thee. Selah.

084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
        are the ways of them.

084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
        rain also filleth the pools.

084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
        appeareth before God.

084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
        Selah.

084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
        anointed.

084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
        rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
        in the tents of wickedness.

084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
        and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
        uprightly.

084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
        brought back the captivity of Jacob.

085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
        covered all their sin. Selah.

085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
        from the fierceness of thine anger.

085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
        us to cease.

085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
        anger to all generations?

085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
        thee?

085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
        peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
        turn again to folly.

085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
        may dwell in our land.

085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
        kissed each other.

085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
        look down from heaven.

085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
        shall yield her increase.

085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
        of his steps.

086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
        servant that trusteth in thee.

086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
        lift up my soul.

086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
        in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
        my supplications.

086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
        answer me.

086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
        are there any works like unto thy works.

086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
        thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
        alone.

086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
        heart to fear thy name.

086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
        will glorify thy name for evermore.

086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
        soul from the lowest hell.

086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
        violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
        before them.

086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
        longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
        thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
        and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
        comforted me.

087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
        of Jacob.

087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
        behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
        there.

087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
        her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
        man was born there. Selah.

087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
        there: all my springs are in thee.

088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
        thee:

088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
        the grave.

088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
        man that hath no strength:

088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
        whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
        hand.

088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
        deeps.

088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
        all thy waves. Selah.

088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
        made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
        come forth.

088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
        daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
        praise thee? Selah.

088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
        faithfulness in destruction?

088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
        in the land of forgetfulness?

088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
        my prayer prevent thee.

088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
        from me?

088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
        suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
        about together.

088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
        acquaintance into darkness.

089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
        will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
        faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
        my servant,

089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
        all generations. Selah.

089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
        faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
        the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
        to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
        to thy faithfulness round about thee?

089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
        arise, thou stillest them.

089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
        hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
        world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
        Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
        right hand.

089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
        and truth shall go before thy face.

089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
        walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
        righteousness shall they be exalted.

089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
        our horn shall be exalted.

089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
        king.

089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
        have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
        chosen out of the people.

089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
        anointed him:

089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
        strengthen him.

089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
        afflict him.

089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
        that hate him.

089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
        name shall his horn be exalted.

089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
        rivers.

089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
        of my salvation.

089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
        the earth.

089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
        shall stand fast with him.

089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
        as the days of heaven.

089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
        iniquity with stripes.

089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
        him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
        out of my lips.

089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
        David.

089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
        before me.

089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
        faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
        thine anointed.

089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
        profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
        strong holds to ruin.

089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
        neighbours.

089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
        made all his enemies to rejoice.

089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
        him to stand in the battle.

089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
        the ground.

089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
        him with shame. Selah.

089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
        wrath burn like fire?

089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
        men in vain?

089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
        deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
        swarest unto David in thy truth?

089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
        my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
        they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
        formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
        everlasting, thou art God.

090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
        children of men.

090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
        is past, and as a watch in the night.

090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
        in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
        it is cut down, and withereth.

090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
        troubled.

090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
        the light of thy countenance.

090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
        years as a tale that is told.

090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
        reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
        strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
        away.

090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
        fear, so is thy wrath.

090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
        unto wisdom.

090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
        thy servants.

090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
        glad all our days.

090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
        us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
        their children.

090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
        establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
        our hands establish thou it.

091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
        abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
        God; in him will I trust.

091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
        from the noisome pestilence.

091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
        shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
        arrow that flieth by day;

091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
        destruction that wasteth at noonday.

091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
        right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
        the wicked.

091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
        most High, thy habitation;

091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
        nigh thy dwelling.

091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
        all thy ways.

091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
        foot against a stone.

091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
        the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
        him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
        him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
        PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
        faithfulness every night,

092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
        the harp with a solemn sound.

092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
        triumph in the works of thy hands.

092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
        deep.

092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
        this.

092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
        of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
        for ever:

092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
        perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
        shall be anointed with fresh oil.

092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
        ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
        me.

092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
        like a cedar in Lebanon.

092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
        in the courts of our God.

092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
        fat and flourishing;

092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
        no unrighteousness in him.

093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
        clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
        world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
        their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
        yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
        O LORD, for ever.

094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
        vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
        the proud.

094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
        triumph?

094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
        workers of iniquity boast themselves?

094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
        heritage.

094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
        fatherless.

094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
        Jacob regard it.

094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
        will ye be wise?

094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
        eye, shall he not see?

094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
        teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
        him out of thy law;

094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
        until the pit be digged for the wicked.

094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
        forsake his inheritance.

094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
        upright in heart shall follow it.

094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
        stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
        silence.

094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
        my soul.

094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
        frameth mischief by a law?

094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
        righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
        refuge.

094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
        them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
        cut them off.

095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
        to the rock of our salvation.

095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
        joyful noise unto him with psalms.

095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
        the hills is his also.

095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
        land.

095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
        LORD our maker.

095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
        the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
        day of temptation in the wilderness:

095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
        It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
        known my ways:

095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
        my rest.

096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
        earth.

096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
        from day to day.

096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
        people.

096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
        feared above all gods.

096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
        his sanctuary.

096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come into his courts.

096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
        all the earth.

096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
        shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
        judge the people righteously.

096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
        sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
        all the trees of the wood rejoice

096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
        earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
        people with his truth.

097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
        isles be glad thereof.

097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
        judgment are the habitation of his throne.

097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
        about.

097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
        trembled.

097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
        presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
        his glory.

097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
        themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
        because of thy judgments, O LORD.

097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
        far above all gods.

097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
        his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
        in heart.

097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
        things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
        victory.

098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
        he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
        Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
        our God.

098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
        noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
        of a psalm.

098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
        the LORD, the King.

098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
        that dwell therein.

098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
        together

098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
        righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
        equity.

099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
        the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
        people.

099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
        equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
        he is holy.

099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
        call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
        them.

099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
        testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
        forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
        inventions.

099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
        LORD our God is holy.

100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
        singing.

100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
        and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
        pasture.

100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
        with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
        endureth to all generations.

101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
        sing.

101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
        come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
        heart.

101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
        of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
        person.

101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
        him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
        suffer.

101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
        may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
        serve me.

101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
        that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
        cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
        incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
        speedily.

102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
        as an hearth.

102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
        to eat my bread.

102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
        skin.

102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
        desert.

102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
        against me are sworn against me.

102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
        weeping.

102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
        lifted me up, and cast me down.

102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
        like grass.

102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
        unto all generations.

102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
        favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
        dust thereof.

102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
        kings of the earth thy glory.

102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
        glory.

102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
        their prayer.

102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
        people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
        heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
        appointed to death;

102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
        Jerusalem;

102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
        serve the LORD.

102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
        thy years are throughout all generations.

102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
        heavens are the work of thy hands.

102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
        shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
        them, and they shall be changed:

102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
        shall be established before thee.

103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
        his holy name.

103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
        diseases;

103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
        with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
        is renewed like the eagle's.

103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
        oppressed.

103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
        of Israel.

103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
        plenteous in mercy.

103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
        ever.

103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
        according to our iniquities.

103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
        mercy toward them that fear him.

103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
        our transgressions from us.

103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
        them that fear him.

103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
        so he flourisheth.

103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
        thereof shall know it no more.

103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
        upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
        children;

103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
        commandments to do them.

103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
        kingdom ruleth over all.

103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
        his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
        do his pleasure.

103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
        bless the LORD, O my soul.

104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
        thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
        stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
        the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
        wind:

104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
        removed for ever.

104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
        stood above the mountains.

104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
        hasted away.

104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
        the place which thou hast founded for them.

104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
        turn not again to cover the earth.

104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
        hills.

104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
        quench their thirst.

104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
        which sing among the branches.

104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
        satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
        service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
        his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
        which he hath planted;

104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
        trees are her house.

104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
        for the conies.

104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
        down.

104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
        of the forest do creep forth.

104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
        from God.

104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
        down in their dens.

104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
        evening.

104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
        them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
        innumerable, both small and great beasts.

104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
        made to play therein.

104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
        meat in due season.

104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
        they are filled with good.

104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
        their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
        renewest the face of the earth.

104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
        rejoice in his works.

104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
        hills, and they smoke.

104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
        praise to my God while I have my being.

104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
        LORD.

104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
        wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
        the LORD.

105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
        his deeds among the people.

105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
        chosen.

105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations.

105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
        an everlasting covenant:

105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance:

105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
        strangers in it.

105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
        another people;

105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes;

105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
        whole staff of bread.

105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
        servant:

105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
        him.

105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
        and let him go free.

105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
        wisdom.

105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
        of Ham.

105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
        than their enemies.

105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
        with his servants.

105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
        Ham.

105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
        against his word.

105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
        of their kings.

105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
        all their coasts.

105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
        trees of their coasts.

105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
        without number,

105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
        fruit of their ground.

105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
        all their strength.

105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
        not one feeble person among their tribes.

105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
        upon them.

105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
        the night.

105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
        with the bread of heaven.

105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
        dry places like a river.

105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
        gladness:

105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
        labour of the people;

105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
        Praise ye the LORD.

106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
        good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
        all his praise?

106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
        righteousness at all times.

106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
        thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
        the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
        inheritance.

106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
        we have done wickedly.

106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
        remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
        at the sea, even at the Red sea.

106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
        make his mighty power to be known.

106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
        them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
        redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
        them left.

106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
        the desert.

106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
        soul.

106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
        LORD.

106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
        company of Abiram.

106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
        the wicked.

106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
        that eateth grass.

106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
        Egypt;

106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
        Red sea.

106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
        his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
        wrath, lest he should destroy them.

106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
        word:

106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
        of the LORD.

106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
        them in the wilderness:

106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
        them in the lands.

106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
        sacrifices of the dead.

106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
        plague brake in upon them.

106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
        plague was stayed.

106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
        generations for evermore.

106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
        ill with Moses for their sakes:

106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
        with his lips.

106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
        commanded them:

106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
        devils,

106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
        their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
        Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
        whoring with their own inventions.

106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
        people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
        hated them ruled over them.

106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
        subjection under their hand.

106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
        their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
        cry:

106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
        according to the multitude of his mercies.

106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
        captives.

106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
        to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
        praise.

106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
        everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
        LORD.

107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
        from the hand of the enemy;

107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
        the west, from the north, and from the south.

107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
        no city to dwell in.

107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
        delivered them out of their distresses.

107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
        a city of habitation.

107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
        soul with goodness.

107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
        bound in affliction and iron;

107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
        the counsel of the most High:

107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
        down, and there was none to help.

107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
        them out of their distresses.

107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
        brake their bands in sunder.

107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
        iron in sunder.

107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
        iniquities, are afflicted.

107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
        unto the gates of death.

107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
        them out of their distresses.

107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
        their destructions.

107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
        declare his works with rejoicing.

107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
        great waters;

107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
        up the waves thereof.

107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
        their soul is melted because of trouble.

107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
        at their wit's end.

107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
        them out of their distresses.

107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
        still.

107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
        unto their desired haven.

107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
        praise him in the assembly of the elders.

107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
        dry ground;

107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
        that dwell therein.

107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
        ground into watersprings.

107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
        a city for habitation;

107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
        fruits of increase.

107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
        and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
        affliction, and sorrow.

107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
        in the wilderness, where there is no way.

107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
        him families like a flock.

107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
        shall stop her mouth.

107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
        understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
        with my glory.

108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
        praises unto thee among the nations.

108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
        reacheth unto the clouds.

108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
        all the earth;

108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
        and answer me.

108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
        of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
        Philistia will I triumph.

108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
        O God, go forth with our hosts?

108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
        opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
        tongue.

109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
        against me without a cause.

109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
        prayer.

109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
        love.

109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
        right hand.

109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
        prayer become sin.

109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
        seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
        strangers spoil his labour.

109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
        be any to favour his fatherless children.

109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
        let their name be blotted out.

109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
        and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
        the memory of them from the earth.

109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
        the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
        heart.

109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
        not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
        so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
        his bones.

109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
        a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
        of them that speak evil against my soul.

109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
        because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
        and down as the locust.

109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
        fatness.

109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
        they shaked their heads.

109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
        hast done it.

109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
        ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
        themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
        praise him among the multitude.

109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
        from those that condemn his soul.

110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
        make thine enemies thy footstool.

110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
        thou in the midst of thine enemies.

110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
        beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
        the dew of thy youth.

110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
        for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
        day of his wrath.

110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
        with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
        countries.

110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
        lift up the head.

111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
        heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
        congregation.

111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
        have pleasure therein.

111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
        gracious and full of compassion.

111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
        mindful of his covenant.

111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
        give them the heritage of the heathen.

111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
        commandments are sure.

111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
        uprightness.

111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
        covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
        understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
        praise endureth for ever.

112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
        that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
        upright shall be blessed.

112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
        gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
        affairs with discretion.

112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
        in everlasting remembrance.

112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
        trusting in the LORD.

112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
        his desire upon his enemies.

112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
        righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
        with honour.

112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
        his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
        perish.

113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
        the name of the LORD.

113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore.

113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
        LORD's name is to be praised.

113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
        heavens.

113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
        and in the earth!

113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
        out of the dunghill;

113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
        people.

113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
        mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
        people of strange language;

114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
        lambs.

114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
        that thou wast driven back?

114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
        like lambs?

114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
        presence of the God of Jacob;

114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
        fountain of waters.

115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
        glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
        pleased.

115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
        see not:

115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
        smell not:

115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
        walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
        shield.

115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
        bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
        children.

115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
        hath he given to the children of men.

115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
        silence.

115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore. Praise the LORD.

116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
        supplications.

116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
        call upon him as long as I live.

116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
        hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
        thee, deliver my soul.

116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
        helped me.

116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
        bountifully with thee.

116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
        tears, and my feet from falling.

116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
        me?

116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
        the LORD.

116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
        of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
        call upon the name of the LORD.

116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
        Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
        the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
        endureth for ever.

118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
        ever.

118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
        for ever.

118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
        set me in a large place.

118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
        me?

118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
        shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        man.

118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        princes.

118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
        will I destroy them.

118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
        the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
        fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
        them.

118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
        helped me.

118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
        the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
        LORD doeth valiantly.

118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
        unto death.

118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
        and I will praise the LORD:

118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
        salvation.

118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
        of the corner.

118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
        be glad in it.

118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
        now prosperity.

118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
        blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
        sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
        will exalt thee.

118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
        the LORD.

119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
        with the whole heart.

119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
        commandments.

119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
        have learned thy righteous judgments.

119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
        thereto according to thy word.

119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
        from thy commandments.

119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
        against thee.

119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
        all riches.

119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
        ways.

119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
        word.

119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
        thy word.

119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
        thy law.

119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
        me.

119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
        judgments at all times.

119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
        thy commandments.

119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
        testimonies.

119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
        meditate in thy statutes.

119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
        thy word.

119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
        of thy wondrous works.

119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
        unto thy word.

119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
        graciously.

119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
        before me.

119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
        shame.

119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
        enlarge my heart.

119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
        unto the end.

119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
        observe it with my whole heart.

119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
        I delight.

119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
        covetousness.

119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
        in thy way.

119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
        fear.

119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
        good.

119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
        righteousness.

119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
        according to thy word.

119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
        for I trust in thy word.

119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
        have hoped in thy judgments.

119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
        not be ashamed.

119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
        loved.

119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
        have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
        caused me to hope.

119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
        quickened me.

119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
        declined from thy law.

119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
        myself.

119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
        forsake thy law.

119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
        kept thy law.

119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
        words.

119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
        me according to thy word.

119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
        forgotten thy law.

119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
        thy righteous judgments.

119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
        keep thy precepts.

119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
        commandments.

119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
        word.

119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
        precepts with my whole heart.

119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
        learn thy statutes.

119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
        and silver.

119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
        understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
        have hoped in thy word.

119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
        faithfulness hast afflicted me.

119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
        according to thy word unto thy servant.

119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
        law is my delight.

119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
        without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
        known thy testimonies.

119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
        me?

119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
        forget thy statutes.

119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
        judgment on them that persecute me?

119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
        law.

119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
        wrongfully; help thou me.

119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
        precepts.

119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
        testimony of thy mouth.

119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
        established the earth, and it abideth.

119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
        are thy servants.

119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
        perished in mine affliction.

119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
        quickened me.

119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
        consider thy testimonies.

119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
        exceeding broad.

119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
        enemies: for they are ever with me.

119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
        testimonies are my meditation.

119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
        precepts.

119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
        keep thy word.

119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
        me.

119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
        to my mouth!

119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
        every false way.

119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
        righteous judgments.

119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
        LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
        law.

119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
        precepts.

119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
        are the rejoicing of my heart.

119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
        unto the end.

119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
        of my God.

119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
        not be ashamed of my hope.

119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
        unto thy statutes continually.

119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
        for their deceit is falsehood.

119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
        therefore I love thy testimonies.

119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
        judgments.

119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
        oppressors.

119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
        me.

119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
        righteousness.

119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
        thy statutes.

119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
        testimonies.

119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
        thy law.

119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
        gold.

119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
        be right; and I hate every false way.

119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
        them.

119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
        understanding unto the simple.

119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
        commandments.

119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
        do unto those that love thy name.

119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
        dominion over me.

119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
        precepts.

119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
        statutes.

119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
        law.

119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
        very faithful.

119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
        thy words.

119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
        is the truth.

119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
        commandments are my delights.

119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
        understanding, and I shall live.

119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
        statutes.

119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
        thy word.

119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
        thy word.

119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
        quicken me according to thy judgment.

119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
        thy law.

119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
        founded them for ever.

119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
        thy law.

119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
        word.

119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
        statutes.

119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
        thy judgments.

119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
        from thy testimonies.

119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
        not thy word.

119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
        according to thy lovingkindness.

119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
        righteous judgments endureth for ever.

119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
        standeth in awe of thy word.

119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
        judgments.

119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
        offend them.

119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
        commandments.

119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
        exceedingly.

119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
        are before thee.

119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
        understanding according to thy word.

119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
        thy word.

119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
        statutes.

119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
        are righteousness.

119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
        delight.

119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
        judgments help me.

119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
        do not forget thy commandments.

120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
        tongue.

120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
        thee, thou false tongue?

120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
        of Kedar!

120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
        help.

121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
        will not slumber.

121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
        sleep.

121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
        hand.

121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
        thy soul.

121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
        this time forth, and even for evermore.

122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
        the LORD.

122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
        testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
        house of David.

122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
        thee.

122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
        be within thee.

122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
        heavens.

123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
        masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
        mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
        he have mercy upon us.

123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
        exceedingly filled with contempt.

123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
        are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
        Israel say;

124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us:

124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
        kindled against us:

124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
        our soul:

124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
        teeth.

124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
        the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
        earth.

125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
        cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
        round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
        righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
        iniquity.

125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
        upright in their hearts.

125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
        shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
        shall be upon Israel.

126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
        them that dream.

126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
        singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
        great things for them.

126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
        doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
        him.

127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
        build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
        but in vain.

127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
        the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
        womb is his reward.

127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
        the youth.

127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
        not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
        gate.

128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
        his ways.

128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
        be, and it shall be well with thee.

128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
        house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
        LORD.

128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
        good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
        Israel.

129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
        now say:

129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
        have not prevailed against me.

129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
        wicked.

129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
        afore it groweth up:

129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
        sheaves his bosom.

129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
        upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
        of my supplications.

130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
        stand?

130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
        feared.

130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
        hope.

130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
        morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
        and with him is plenteous redemption.

130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
        I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
        me.

131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
        weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
        Jacob;

132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
        up into my bed;

132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
        eyelids,

132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
        mighty God of Jacob.

132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
        the wood.

132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
        footstool.

132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
        strength.

132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
        saints shout for joy.

132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
        anointed.

132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
        it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
        shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
        throne for evermore.

132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
        habitation.

132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
        desired it.

132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
        with bread.

132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
        shall shout aloud for joy.

132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
        lamp for mine anointed.

132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
        his crown flourish.

133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
        together in unity!

133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
        upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
        skirts of his garments;

133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
        mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
        even life for evermore.

134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
        by night stand in the house of the LORD.

134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
        him, O ye servants of the LORD.

135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
        house of our God.

135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
        name; for it is pleasant.

135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
        his peculiar treasure.

135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
        all gods.

135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
        earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
        his treasuries.

135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
        upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
        kingdoms of Canaan:

135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
        his people.

135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
        throughout all generations.

135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
        concerning his servants.

135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
        men's hands.

135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
        see not;

135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.

135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
        Aaron:

135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
        the LORD.

135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
        Praise ye the LORD.

136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.

137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
        song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
        Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
        cunning.

137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
        my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
        Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
        thereof.

137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
        be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
        against the stones.

138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
        sing praise unto thee.

138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
        thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
        thy word above all thy name.

138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
        me with strength in my soul.

138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
        they hear the words of thy mouth.

138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
        glory of the LORD.

138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
        but the proud he knoweth afar off.

138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
        thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
        enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
        LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
        hands.

139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
        understandest my thought afar off.

139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
        with all my ways.

139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
        knowest it altogether.

139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
        me.

139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
        attain unto it.

139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
        from thy presence?

139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
        in hell, behold, thou art there.

139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;

139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
        hold me.

139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
        shall be light about me.

139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
        as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
        mother's womb.

139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
        marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
        and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
        thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
        were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
        is the sum of them!

139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
        when I awake, I am still with thee.

139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
        therefore, ye bloody men.

139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
        thy name in vain.

139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
        grieved with those that rise up against thee?

139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
        thoughts:

139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
        way everlasting.

140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
        violent man;

140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
        gathered together for war.

140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
        poison is under their lips. Selah.

140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
        from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
        goings.

140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
        a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
        supplications, O LORD.

140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
        covered my head in the day of battle.

140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
        wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
        mischief of their own lips cover them.

140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
        fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
        shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and the right of the poor.

140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
        upright shall dwell in thy presence.

141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
        voice, when I cry unto thee.

141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
        lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
        lips.

141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
        works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
        dainties.

141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
        him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
        break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
        calamities.

141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
        hear my words; for they are sweet.

141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
        cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
        trust; leave not my soul destitute.

141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
        gins of the workers of iniquity.

141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
        escape.

142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
        LORD did I make my supplication.

142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
        trouble.

142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
        path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
        snare for me.

142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
        that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
        soul.

142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
        portion in the land of the living.

142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
        my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
        righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
        bountifully with me.

143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
        faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
        shall no man living be justified.

143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
        down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
        those that have been long dead.

143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
        me is desolate.

143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
        muse on the work of thy hands.

143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
        thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
        from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
        thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
        walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
        hide me.

143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
        good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
        righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
        that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
        war, and my fingers to fight:

144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
        my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
        under me.

144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
        son of man, that thou makest account of him!

144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
        away.

144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
        and they shall smoke.

144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
        arrows, and destroy them.

144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
        great waters, from the hand of strange children;

144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.

144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
        David his servant from the hurtful sword.

144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
        whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood:

144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
        our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
        similitude of a palace:

144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
        that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
        our streets:

144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
        breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
        our streets.

144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
        that people, whose God is the LORD.

145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
        for ever and ever.

145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
        ever and ever.

145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
        greatness is unsearchable.

145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
        declare thy mighty acts.

145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
        wondrous works.

145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
        will declare thy greatness.

145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
        and shall sing of thy righteousness.

145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
        and of great mercy.

145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
        his works.

145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
        bless thee.

145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
        power;

145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
        glorious majesty of his kingdom.

145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
        endureth throughout all generations.

145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
        that be bowed down.

145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
        meat in due season.

145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
        living thing.

145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
        works.

145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
        call upon him in truth.

145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
        hear their cry, and will save them.

145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
        will he destroy.

145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
        bless his holy name for ever and ever.

146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
        my God while I have any being.

146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
        there is no help.

146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
        very day his thoughts perish.

146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
        hope is in the LORD his God:

146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
        is: which keepeth truth for ever:

146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
        to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
        that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
        and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
        generations. Praise ye the LORD.

147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
        God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
        outcasts of Israel.

147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
        their names.

147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
        infinite.

147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
        the ground.

147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
        harp unto our God:

147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
        the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
        cry.

147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
        pleasure in the legs of a man.

147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
        hope in his mercy.

147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
        blessed thy children within thee.

147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
        finest of the wheat.

147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
        very swiftly.

147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
        ashes.

147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
        his cold?

147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.

147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
        unto Israel.

147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
        judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
        praise him in the heights.

148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
        light.

148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
        the heavens.

148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
        they were created.

148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
        decree which shall not pass.

148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
        word:

148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
        the earth:

148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
        excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
        saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
        him. Praise ye the LORD.

149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
        praise in the congregation of saints.

149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
        Zion be joyful in their King.

149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
        unto him with the timbrel and harp.

149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
        the meek with salvation.

149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
        their beds.

149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;

149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
        the people;

149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
        of iron;

149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
        all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
        the firmament of his power.

150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
        excellent greatness.

150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
        psaltery and harp.

150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
        stringed instruments and organs.

150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
        sounding cymbals.

150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
        the LORD.

Book 20	Proverbs

001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
        understanding;

001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
        and equity;

001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
        discretion.

001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
        understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
        the wise, and their dark sayings.

001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
        despise wisdom and instruction.

001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
        the law of thy mother:

001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
        chains about thy neck.

001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
        lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
        that go down into the pit:

001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
        with spoil:

001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
        from their path:

001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
        their own lives.

001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
        taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
        the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
        scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
        you, I will make known my words unto you.

001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
        hand, and no man regarded;

001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
        reproof:

001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
        cometh;

001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
        cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
        you.

001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
        shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
        the LORD:

001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
        filled with their own devices.

001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
        prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
        quiet from fear of evil.

002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
        commandments with thee;

002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
        heart to understanding;

002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
        for understanding;

002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
        hid treasures;

002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
        knowledge of God.

002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
        and understanding.

002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
        to them that walk uprightly.

002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
        his saints.

002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
        equity; yea, every good path.

002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
        pleasant unto thy soul;

002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
        that speaketh froward things;

002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
        darkness;

002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
        wicked;

002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
        which flattereth with her words;

002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
        covenant of her God.

002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
        dead.

002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
        the paths of life.

002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
        paths of the righteous.

002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
        remain in it.

002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
        transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
        commandments:

003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
        to thee.

003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
        neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.

003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
        thine own understanding.

003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
        paths.

003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
        evil.

003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
        of all thine increase:

003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
        shall burst out with new wine.

003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
        weary of his correction:

003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
        son in whom he delighteth.

003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
        understanding.

003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
        silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
        canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
        riches and honour.

003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
        peace.

003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
        happy is every one that retaineth her.

003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
        hath he established the heavens.

003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
        down the dew.

003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
        and discretion:

003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
        stumble.

003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
        shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
        wicked, when it cometh.

003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
        from being taken.

003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
        the power of thine hand to do it.

003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
        I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
        securely by thee.

003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
        harm.

003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
        with the righteous.

003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
        blesseth the habitation of the just.

003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
        lowly.

003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
        of fools.

004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
        know understanding.

004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
        sight of my mother.

004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
        words: keep my commandments, and live.

004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
        from the words of my mouth.

004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
        she shall keep thee.

004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
        all thy getting get understanding.

004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
        honour, when thou dost embrace her.

004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
        glory shall she deliver to thee.

004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
        life shall be many.

004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
        right paths.

004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
        thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
        she is thy life.

004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
        of evil men.

004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
        sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
        violence.

004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
        more and more unto the perfect day.

004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
        they stumble.

004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
        thine heart.

004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
        their flesh.

004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
        issues of life.

004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
        from thee.

004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
        straight before thee.

004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
        established.

004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
        from evil.

005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
        understanding:

005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
        knowledge.

005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
        mouth is smoother than oil:

005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
        moveable, that thou canst not know them.

005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
        words of my mouth.

005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
        house:

005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
        the cruel:

005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
        in the house of a stranger;

005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
        consumed,

005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
        reproof;

005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
        mine ear to them that instructed me!

005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
        assembly.

005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
        of thine own well.

005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
        the streets.

005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
        youth.

005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
        breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
        with her love.

005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
        and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
        pondereth all his goings.

005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
        be holden with the cords of his sins.

005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
        folly he shall go astray.

006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
        stricken thy hand with a stranger,

006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
        with the words of thy mouth.

006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
        into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
        thy friend.

006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
        bird from the hand of the fowler.

006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
        the harvest.

006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
        of thy sleep?

006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
        as an armed man.

006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
        teacheth with his fingers;

006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
        he soweth discord.

006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
        be broken without remedy.

006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
        abomination unto him:

006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
        blood,

006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
        in running to mischief,

006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
        among brethren.

006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
        of thy mother:

006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
        neck.

006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
        shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
        thee.

006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
        reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
        tongue of a strange woman.

006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
        thee with her eyelids.

006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
        bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
        burned?

006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
        toucheth her shall not be innocent.

006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
        when he is hungry;

006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
        all the substance of his house.

006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
        understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
        be wiped away.

006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
        in the day of vengeance.
006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
        though thou givest many gifts.

007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
        thine eye.

007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
        heart.

007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
        thy kinswoman:

007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
        stranger which flattereth with her words.

007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
        youths, a young man void of understanding,

007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
        way to her house,

007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
        harlot, and subtil of heart.

007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
        every corner.)

007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
        said unto him,

007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
        face, and I have found thee.

007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
        works, with fine linen of Egypt.

007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
        solace ourselves with loves.

007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
        the day appointed.

007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
        flattering of her lips she forced him.

007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
        slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
        snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
        the words of my mouth.

007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
        paths.

007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
        been slain by her.

007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
        death.

008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
        places of the paths.

008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
        coming in at the doors.

008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
        understanding heart.

008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
        my lips shall be right things.

008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
        abomination to my lips.

008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
        nothing froward or perverse in them.

008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
        them that find knowledge.

008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
        than choice gold.

008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
        be desired are not to be compared to it.

008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
        inventions.

008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
        and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
        strength.

008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
        earth.

008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
        find me.

008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
        righteousness.

008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
        revenue than choice silver.

008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
        of judgment:

008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
        I will fill their treasures.

008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
        works of old.

008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
        earth was.

008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
        were no fountains abounding with water.

008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
        brought forth:

008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
        the highest part of the dust of the world.

008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
        compass upon the face of the depth:

008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
        fountains of the deep:

008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
        pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
        earth:

008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
        his delight, rejoicing always before him;

008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
        were with the sons of men.

008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
        they that keep my ways.

008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
        gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
        the LORD.

008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
        that hate me love death.

009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
        pillars:

009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
        hath also furnished her table.

009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
        places of the city,

009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
        mingled.

009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
        understanding.

009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
        that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
        and he will love thee.

009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
        teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
        knowledge of the holy is understanding.

009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
        life shall be increased.

009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
        scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
        nothing.

009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
        high places of the city,

009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
        pleasant.

009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
        guests are in the depths of hell.

010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
        a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
        but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
        of the diligent maketh rich.

010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
        sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
        the mouth of the wicked.

010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
        shall rot.

010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
        perverteth his ways shall be known.

010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
        covereth the mouth of the wicked.

010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
        but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
        understanding.

010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
        near destruction.

010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
        the poor is their poverty.

010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
        wicked to sin.

010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
        refuseth reproof erreth.

010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
        slander, is a fool.

010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
        refraineth his lips is wise.

010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
        wicked is little worth.

010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
        wisdom.

010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
        sorrow with it.

010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
        understanding hath wisdom.

010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
        of the righteous shall be granted.

010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
        righteous is an everlasting foundation.

010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
        sluggard to them that send him.

010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
        wicked shall be shortened.

010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
        expectation of the wicked shall perish.

010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
        destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
        inhabit the earth.

010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
        tongue shall be cut out.

010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
        mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
        is his delight.

011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
        wisdom.

011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
        perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
        wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
        transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
        hope of unjust men perisheth.

011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        cometh in his stead.

011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
        through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
        when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
        overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
        of understanding holdeth his peace.

011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
        spirit concealeth the matter.

011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
        counsellors there is safety.

011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
        that hateth suretiship is sure.

011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
        riches.

011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
        cruel troubleth his own flesh.

011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
        righteousness shall be a sure reward.

011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
        pursueth it to his own death.

011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
        but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
        but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
        which is without discretion.

011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.

011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
        that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
        be watered also himself.

011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
        blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
        seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
        shall flourish as a branch.

011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
        the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
        winneth souls is wise.

011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
        more the wicked and the sinner.

012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
        reproof is brutish.

012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
        devices will he condemn.

012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
        the righteous shall not be moved.

012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
        maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
        the wicked are deceit.

012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
        mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
        righteous shall stand.

012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
        is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
        that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
        tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
        that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
        righteous yieldeth fruit.

012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
        just shall come out of trouble.

012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
        and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
        him.

012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
        hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
        shame.

012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
        false witness deceit.

012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
        tongue of the wise is health.

012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
        tongue is but for a moment.

012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
        counsellors of peace is joy.

012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
        be filled with mischief.

012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
        truly are his delight.

012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
        proclaimeth foolishness.

012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
        shall be under tribute.

012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
        maketh it glad.

012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
        way of the wicked seduceth them.

012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
        but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
        thereof there is no death.

013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
        heareth not rebuke.

013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
        of the transgressors shall eat violence.

013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
        openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
        soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
        and cometh to shame.

013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
        wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
        that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
        heareth not rebuke.

013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
        wicked shall be put out.

013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
        wisdom.

013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
        gathereth by labour shall increase.

013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
        cometh, it is a tree of life.

013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
        feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
        is hard.

013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
        open his folly.

013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
        ambassador is health.

013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
        but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
        abomination to fools to depart from evil.

013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
        of fools shall be destroyed.

013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
        repayed.

013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
        and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
        destroyed for want of judgment.

013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
        chasteneth him betimes.

013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
        belly of the wicked shall want.

014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
        it down with her hands.

014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
        that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
        the wise shall preserve them.

014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
        the strength of the ox.

014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
        utter lies.

014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
        easy unto him that understandeth.

014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
        not in him the lips of knowledge.

014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
        folly of fools is deceit.

014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
        favour.

014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
        intermeddle with his joy.

014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
        tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
        mirth is heaviness.

014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
        a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
        well to his going.

014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
        rageth, and is confident.

014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
        devices is hated.

014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
        knowledge.

014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
        the righteous.

014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
        many friends.

014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
        mercy on the poor, happy is he.

014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
        to them that devise good.

014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
        tendeth only to penury.

014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
        fools is folly.

014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
        speaketh lies.

014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
        shall have a place of refuge.

014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
        want of people is the destruction of the prince.

014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
        that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
        rottenness of the bones.

014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
        honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
        hath hope in his death.

014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
        but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
        people.

014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
        against him that causeth shame.

015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
        anger.

015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
        of fools poureth out foolishness.

015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
        and the good.

015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
        is a breach in the spirit.

015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
        regardeth reproof is prudent.

015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
        revenues of the wicked is trouble.

015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
        foolish doeth not so.

015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
        the prayer of the upright is his delight.

015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
        loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
        that hateth reproof shall die.

015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men?

015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
        go unto the wise.

015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
        the heart the spirit is broken.

015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
        but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
        merry heart hath a continual feast.

015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
        and trouble therewith.

015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
        and hatred therewith.

015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
        anger appeaseth strife.

015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
        way of the righteous is made plain.

015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
        his mother.

015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
        understanding walketh uprightly.

015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
        multitude of counsellors they are established.

015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
        in due season, how good is it!

015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
        hell beneath.

015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
        establish the border of the widow.

015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
        the words of the pure are pleasant words.

015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
        hateth gifts shall live.

015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
        of the wicked poureth out evil things.

015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
        the righteous.

015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
        maketh the bones fat.

015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
        wise.

015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
        that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
        honour is humility.

016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
        tongue, is from the LORD.

016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
        weigheth the spirits.

016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
        established.

016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
        wicked for the day of evil.

016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
        LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
        LORD men depart from evil.

016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.

016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
        without right.

016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
        steps.

016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
        transgresseth not in judgment.

016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
        the bag are his work.

016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
        throne is established by righteousness.

016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
        that speaketh right.

016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
        will pacify it.

016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
        is as a cloud of the latter rain.

016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
        understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
        keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
        fall.

016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
        divide the spoil with the proud.

016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
        trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
        of the lips increaseth learning.

016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
        but the instruction of fools is folly.

016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
        to his lips.

016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
        health to the bones.

016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
        it of him.

016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
        burning fire.

016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
        friends.

016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
        way that is not good.

016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
        he bringeth evil to pass.

016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
        of righteousness.

016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
        that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
        is of the LORD.

017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
        full of sacrifices with strife.

017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
        and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
        the LORD trieth the hearts.

017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
        to a naughty tongue.

017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
        glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
        children are their fathers.

017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
        a prince.

017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
        whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
        repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
        stripes into a fool.

017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
        messenger shall be sent against him.

017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.

017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
        house.

017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
        therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
        just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
        wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
        adversity.

017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
        surety in the presence of his friend.

017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
        exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
        a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
        father of a fool hath no joy.

017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
        drieth the bones.

017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
        ways of judgment.

017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
        a fool are in the ends of the earth.

017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
        that bare him.

017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
        equity.

017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
        understanding is of an excellent spirit.

017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
        he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
        intermeddleth with all wisdom.

018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
        may discover itself.

018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
        ignominy reproach.

018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
        wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
        overthrow the righteous in judgment.

018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
        strokes.

018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
        of his soul.

018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
        a great waster.

018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
        into it, and is safe.

018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
        in his own conceit.

018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
        honour is humility.

018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
        and shame unto him.

018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
        spirit who can bear?

018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
        wise seeketh knowledge.

018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
        great men.

018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
        neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
        mighty.

018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
        their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
        and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
        love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
        favour of the LORD.

018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
        is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
        is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
        he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
        fretteth against the LORD.

019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
        neighbour.

019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall not escape.

019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
        friend to him that giveth gifts.

019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
        friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
        are wanting to him.

019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
        understanding shall find good.

019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall perish.

019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
        have rule over princes.

019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
        glory to pass over a transgression.

019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
        is as dew upon the grass.

019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
        contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
        wife is from the LORD.

019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
        suffer hunger.

019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
        that despiseth his ways shall die.

019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
        that which he hath given will he pay him again.

019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
        spare for his crying.

019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
        deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
        wise in thy latter end.

019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
        counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
        than a liar.

019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
        shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
        much as bring it to his mouth again.

019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
        that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
        son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
        from the words of knowledge.

019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
        wicked devoureth iniquity.

019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
        of fools.

020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
        deceived thereby is not wise.

020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
        provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
        will be meddling.

020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
        shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
        understanding will draw it out.

020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
        faithful man who can find?

020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
        blessed after him.

020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
        all evil with his eyes.

020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
        sin?

020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
        abomination to the LORD.

020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
        and whether it be right.

020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
        both of them.

020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
        and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasteth.

020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
        knowledge are a precious jewel.

020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
        shall be filled with gravel.

020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
        make war.

020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
        therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in obscure darkness.

020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
        end thereof shall not be blessed.

020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
        and he shall save thee.

020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
        balance is not good.

020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
        his own way?

020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
        after vows to make enquiry.

020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
        them.

020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
        inward parts of the belly.

020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
        by mercy.

020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
        old men is the grey head.

020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
        inward parts of the belly.

021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
        water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
        pondereth the hearts.

021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
        sacrifice.

021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
        wicked, is sin.

021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
        of every one that is hasty only to want.

021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
        to and fro of them that seek death.

021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
        refuse to do judgment.

021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
        his work is right.

021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
        brawling woman in a wide house.

021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
        favour in his eyes.

021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
        when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
        but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
        cry himself, but shall not be heard.

021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
        strong wrath.

021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
        to the workers of iniquity.

021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
        remain in the congregation of the dead.

021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
        wine and oil shall not be rich.

021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
        transgressor for the upright.

021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
        contentious and an angry woman.

021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
        wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
        righteousness, and honour.

021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
        the strength of the confidence thereof.

021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
        troubles.

021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
        wrath.

021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
        to labour.

021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
        giveth and spareth not.

021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
        when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
        speaketh constantly.

021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
        directeth his way.

021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
        LORD.

021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
        of the LORD.

022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
        loving favour rather than silver and gold.

022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
        all.

022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
        and life.

022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
        keep his soul shall be far from them.

022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
        he will not depart from it.

022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
        the lender.

022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
        anger shall fail.

022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
        of his bread to the poor.

022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
        and reproach shall cease.

022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
        the king shall be his friend.

022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
        the words of the transgressor.

022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
        slain in the streets.

022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
        of the LORD shall fall therein.

022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
        correction shall drive it far from him.

022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
        that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
        thine heart unto my knowledge.

022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
        shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
        this day, even to thee.

022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
        knowledge,

022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
        truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
        that send unto thee?

022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
        afflicted in the gate:

022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
        those that spoiled them.

022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
        thou shalt not go:

022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
        sureties for debts.

022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
        from under thee?

022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
        before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
        what is before thee:

023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
        appetite.

023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
        certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
        toward heaven.

023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
        desire thou his dainty meats:

023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
        saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
        thy sweet words.

023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
        wisdom of thy words.

023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
        the fatherless:

023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
        thee.

023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
        words of knowledge.

023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
        him with the rod, he shall not die.

023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
        from hell.

023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
        mine.

023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
        the LORD all the day long.

023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
        cut off.

023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
        way.

023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
        drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
        mother when she is old.

023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
        and understanding.

023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
        begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
        thee shall rejoice.

023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
        ways.

023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
        pit.

023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
        transgressors among men.

023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
        babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
        eyes?

023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
        wine.

023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
        colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
        adder.

023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
        utter perverse things.

023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
        sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
        they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
        will seek it yet again.

024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
        with them.

024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
        mischief.

024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
        established:

024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
        precious and pleasant riches.

024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
        strength.

024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
        of counsellors there is safety.

024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
        gate.

024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
        person.

024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
        abomination to men.

024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
        those that are ready to be slain;

024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
        pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
        doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
        according to his works?

024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
        which is sweet to thy taste:

024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
        hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
        expectation shall not be cut off.

024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
        righteous; spoil not his resting place:

024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
        the wicked shall fall into mischief.

024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
        be glad when he stumbleth:

024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.

024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
        at the wicked:

024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
        the wicked shall be put out.

024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
        them that are given to change:

024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
        ruin of them both?

024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
        respect of persons in judgment.

024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
        the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
        blessing shall come upon them.

024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
        field; and afterwards build thine house.

024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
        deceive not with thy lips.

024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
        render to the man according to his work.

024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
        the man void of understanding;

024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
        covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
        broken down.

024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
        received instruction.

024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
        as an armed man.

025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.

025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
        kings is to search out a matter.

025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
        of kings is unsearchable.

025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
        forth a vessel for the finer.

025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
        shall be established in righteousness.

025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
        not in the place of great men:

025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
        than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
        prince whom thine eyes have seen.

025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
        in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
        a secret to another:

025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
        turn not away.

025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
        silver.

025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
        wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
        his masters.

025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
        without rain.

025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
        breaketh the bone.

025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
        lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
        of thee, and so hate thee.

025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
        maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
        broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
        vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
        heart.

025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
        thirsty, give him water to drink:

025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
        shall reward thee.

025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
        a backbiting tongue.

025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
        a brawling woman and in a wide house.

025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
        country.

025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
        troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
        own glory is not glory.

025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
        is broken down, and without walls.

026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
        seemly for a fool.

026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
        curse causeless shall not come.

026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
        fool's back.

026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
        like unto him.

026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
        own conceit.

026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
        the feet, and drinketh damage.

026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
        mouth of fools.

026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
        honour to a fool.

026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
        parable in the mouths of fools.

026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
        and rewardeth transgressors.

026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
        folly.

026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
        of a fool than of him.

026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
        in the streets.

026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
        his bed.

026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
        bring it again to his mouth.

026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
        can render a reason.

026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
        him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
        I in sport?

026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
        no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
        contentious man to kindle strife.

026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
        with silver dross.

026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
        within him;

026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
        abominations in his heart.

026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
        shewed before the whole congregation.

026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
        stone, it will return upon him.

026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
        flattering mouth worketh ruin.

027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
        day may bring forth.

027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
        stranger, and not thine own lips.

027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
        heavier than them both.

027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
        stand before envy?

027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
        enemy are deceitful.

027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
        every bitter thing is sweet.

027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
        wandereth from his place.

027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
        of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
        neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
        calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
        brother far off.

027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
        that reproacheth me.

027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
        the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
        woman are alike.

027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
        right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
        his friend.

027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
        that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
        man.

027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
        never satisfied.

027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
        a man to his praise.
027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
        a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
        well to thy herds.

027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
        every generation?

027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
        herbs of the mountains are gathered.

027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
        the field.

027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
        food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
        maidens.

028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
        bold as a lion.

028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
        but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
        shall be prolonged.

028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
        which leaveth no food.

028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
        the law contend with them.

028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
        understand all things.

028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
        that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
        companion of riotous men shameth his father.

028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
        shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
        prayer shall be abomination.

028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
        shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
        have good things in possession.

028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
        hath understanding searcheth him out.

028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
        the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
        confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
        heart shall fall into mischief.

028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
        over the poor people.

028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
        oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
        days.

028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
        flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
        perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
        that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
        haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
        bread that man will transgress.

028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
        not that poverty shall come upon him.

028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
        he that flattereth with the tongue.

028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
        transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
        putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
        wisely, he shall be delivered.

028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
        hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
        perish, the righteous increase.

029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
        suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
        when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
        company with harlots spendeth his substance.

029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
        receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
        feet.

029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
        righteous doth sing and rejoice.

029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
        wicked regardeth not to know it.

029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
        wrath.

029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
        or laugh, there is no rest.

029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
        till afterwards.

029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
        lighteneth both their eyes.

029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
        established for ever.

029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
        bringeth his mother to shame.

029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
        the righteous shall see their fall.

029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
        give delight unto thy soul.

029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
        keepeth the law, happy is he.

029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
        understand he will not answer.

029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
        hope of a fool than of him.

029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
        have him become his son at the length.

029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
        in transgression.

029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
        humble in spirit.

029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
        cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
        in the LORD shall be safe.

029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
        from the LORD.

029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
        upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
        spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
        understanding of a man.

030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
        gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
        garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
        is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
        their trust in him.

030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
        found a liar.

030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
        die:

030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
        nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
        lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
        vain.

030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
        thou be found guilty.

030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
        bless their mother.

030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
        is not washed from their filthiness.

030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
        eyelids are lifted up.

030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
        jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
        and the needy from among men.

030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
        are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
        say not, It is enough:

030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
        with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
        mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
        young eagles shall eat it.

030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
        four which I know not:

030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
        rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
        of a man with a maid.

030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
        her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
        it cannot bear:

030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
        with meat;

030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
        is heir to her mistress.

030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
        are exceeding wise:

030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
        in the summer;

030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks;

030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
        bands;

030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
        palaces.

030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
        going:

030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
        for any;

030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
        is no rising up.

030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
        hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
        wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
        wrath bringeth forth strife.

031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
        him.

031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
        of my vows?

031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
        destroyeth kings.

031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
        wine; nor for princes strong drink:

031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
        of any of the afflicted.

031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
        unto those that be of heavy hearts.

031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
        no more.

031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
        appointed to destruction.

031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
        poor and needy.

031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
        rubies.

031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
        shall have no need of spoil.

031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
        hands.

031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
        afar.

031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
        household, and a portion to her maidens.

031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
        hands she planteth a vineyard.

031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
        arms.

031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
        not out by night.

031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
        distaff.

031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
        forth her hands to the needy.

031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.

031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
        and purple.

031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
        elders of the land.

031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
        unto the merchant.

031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
        time to come.

031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
        law of kindness.

031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
        the bread of idleness.

031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
        and he praiseth her.

031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
        all.

031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
        feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
        praise her in the gates.

Book 21	Ecclesiastes

001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
        Jerusalem.

001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
        all is vanity.

001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
        the sun?

001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
        but the earth abideth for ever.

001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
        his place where he arose.

001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
        north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
        again according to his circuits.

001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
        the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
        again.

001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
        which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
        thing under the sun.

001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
        it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
        be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
        shall come after.

001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
        concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
        travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
        therewith.

001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
        behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
        is wanting cannot be numbered.

001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
        estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
        been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
        experience of wisdom and knowledge.

001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
        folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
        knowledge increaseth sorrow.

002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
        therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
        acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
        till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
        they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
        vineyards:

002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
        all kind of fruits:

002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
        bringeth forth trees:

002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
        house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
        above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
        of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
        singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
        instruments, and that of all sorts.

002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
        me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
        withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
        all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
        on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
        vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
        the sun.

002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
        for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
        which hath been already done.

002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
        excelleth darkness.

002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
        darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
        to them all.

002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
        happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
        said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
        for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
        all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
        the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
        spirit.

002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
        because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
        shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
        and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
        also vanity.

002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
        labour which I took under the sun.

002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
        knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
        therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
        and a great evil.

002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
        his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
        heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
        drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
        labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
        knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
        gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
        before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
        under the heaven:

003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
        time to pluck up that which is planted;

003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
        a time to build up;

003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
        time to dance;

003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
        together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
        embracing;

003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away;

003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
        a time to speak;

003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
        of peace.

003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
        men to be exercised in it.

003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
        set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
        work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
        rejoice, and to do good in his life.

003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
        good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
        nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
        doeth it, that men should fear before him.

003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
        already been; and God requireth that which is past.

003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
        wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
        iniquity was there.

003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
        wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
        every work.

003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
        that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
        they themselves are beasts.

003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
        even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
        other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
        preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

003:020 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
        dust again.

003:021 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
        spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

003:022 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
        man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
        for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

004:001 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
        done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
        oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
        oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

004:002 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
        the living which are yet alive.

004:003 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
        hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

004:004 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
        for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
        and vexation of spirit.

004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
        with travail and vexation of spirit.

004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
        neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
        labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
        saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
        This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
        their labour.

004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
        him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
        help him up.

004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
        one be warm alone?

004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
        threefold cord is not quickly broken.

004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
        king, who will no more be admonished.

004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
        born in his kingdom becometh poor.

004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
        second child that shall stand up in his stead.

004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
        before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
        him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
        ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
        consider not that they do evil.

005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
        to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
        upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
        fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
        hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
        shouldest vow and not pay.

005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
        thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
        God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
        hands?

005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
        divers vanities: but fear thou God.

005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
        perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
        at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
        regardeth; and there be higher than they.

005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
        is served by the field.

005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
        he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
        what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
        of them with their eyes?

005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
        or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
        sleep.

005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
        riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
        son, and there is nothing in his hand.

005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
        to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
        he may carry away in his hand.

005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
        the wind?

005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
        sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
        to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
        that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
        God giveth him: for it is his portion.

005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
        hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
        God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
        common among men:

006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
        that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
        yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
        eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
        that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
        with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
        untimely birth is better than he.

006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
        his name shall be covered with darkness.

006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
        hath more rest than the other.

006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
        seen no good: do not all go to one place?

006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
        is not filled.

006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
        that knoweth to walk before the living?

006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
        desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
        is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
        he.

006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
        the better?

006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
        days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
        can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
        death than the day of one's birth.

007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
        house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
        living will lay it to his heart.

007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
        countenance the heart is made better.

007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
        heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
        hear the song of fools.

007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
        of the fool: this also is vanity.

007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
        the heart.

007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
        the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
        the bosom of fools.

007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
        better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
        this.

007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
        to them that see the sun.

007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
        excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
        that have it.

007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
        which he hath made crooked?

007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
        adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
        other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

007:015 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
        just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
        wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

007:016 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
        why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?

007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
        shouldest thou die before thy time?

007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
        from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
        shall come forth of them all.

007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
        are in the city.

007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
        sinneth not.

007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
        hear thy servant curse thee:

007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
        likewise hast cursed others.

007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
        it was far from me.

007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
        out?

007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
        wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
        of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
        snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
        shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
        one, to find out the account:

007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
        thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
        found.

007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
        but they have sought out many inventions.

008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
        a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
        boldness of his face shall be changed.

008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
        regard of the oath of God.

008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
        thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
        unto him, What doest thou?

008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
        wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
        the misery of man is great upon him.

008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
        when it shall be?

008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
        spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
        is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those that are given to it.

008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
        that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
        ruleth over another to his own hurt.

008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
        place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
        they had so done: this is also vanity.

008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
        speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
        in them to do evil.

008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
        prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
        that fear God, which fear before him:

008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
        prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
        not before God.

008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
        just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
        wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
        according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
        is vanity.

008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
        that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
        which God giveth him under the sun.

008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
        business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
        neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
        the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
        labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
        though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
        to find it.

009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
        this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
        in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
        all that is before them.

009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
        righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
        and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
        sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
        sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
        that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
        sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
        while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
        a living dog is better than a dead lion.

009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
        any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
        of them is forgotten.

009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
        perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
        thing that is done under the sun.

009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
        merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
        ointment.

009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
        the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
        sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
        this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
        there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
        the grave, whither thou goest.

009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
        swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
        wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
        to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
        taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
        snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
        falleth suddenly upon them.

009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
        great unto me:

009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
        a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
        bulwarks against it:

009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
        wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
        poor man.

009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
        poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
        him that ruleth among fools.

009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
        destroyeth much good.

010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
        a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
        reputation for wisdom and honour.

010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
        his left.

010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
        wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
        fool.

010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
        place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
        which proceedeth from the ruler:

010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
        servants upon the earth.

010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
        an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

010:009 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
        cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

010:010 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
        he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

010:011 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
        babbler is no better.

010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
        a fool will swallow up himself.

010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
        the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

010:014 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
        and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

010:015 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
        he knoweth not how to go to the city.

010:016 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
        eat in the morning!

010:017 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
        and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
        drunkenness!

010:018 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
        idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
        answereth all things.

010:020 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
        rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
        voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

011:001 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
        many days.

011:002 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
        not what evil shall be upon the earth.

011:003 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
        earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
        north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

011:004 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
        regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

011:005 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
        bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
        thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

011:006 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
        thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
        this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
        eyes to behold the sun:

011:008 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
        him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
        that cometh is vanity.

011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
        thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
        heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
        all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
        thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
        evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
        say, I have no pleasure in them;

012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
        darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
        the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
        because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
        be darkened,

012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
        the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
        bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
        fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
        and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
        because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
        the streets:

012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
        broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
        broken at the cistern.

012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
        spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
        and set in order many proverbs.

012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
        which was written was upright, even words of truth.

012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
        the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
        books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
        flesh.

012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
        keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
        secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Book 22	Song of Solomon

001:001 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
        better than wine.

001:003 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
        ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

001:004 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
        his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
        remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

001:005 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
        tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

001:006 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
        looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
        made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
        have I not kept.

001:007 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
        thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
        one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

001:008 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
        by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
        shepherds' tents.

001:009 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
        Pharaoh's chariots.

001:010 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
        chains of gold.

001:011 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

001:012 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
        forth the smell thereof.

001:013 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
        night betwixt my breasts.

001:014 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
        vineyards of Engedi.

001:015 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes.

001:016 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed
        is green.

001:017 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

002:001 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

002:002 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
        beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
        delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

002:004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
        was love.

002:005 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
        love.

002:006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
        embrace me.

002:007 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

002:008 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
        mountains, skipping upon the hills.

002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
        behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing
        himself through the lattice.

002:010 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:011 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

002:012 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of
        birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
        land;

002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
        the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
        places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
        thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
        comely.

002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
        our vines have tender grapes.

002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
        beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
        mountains of Bether.

003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
        the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
        Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him
        whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
        until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
        chamber of her that conceived me.

003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
        smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
        of the merchant?

003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are
        about it, of the valiant of Israel.

003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
        sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
        gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being
        paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
        the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
        espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
        goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
        came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
        none is barren among them.

004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is
        comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within
        thy locks.

004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
        whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
        men.

004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which
        feed among the lilies.

004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
        to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
        look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
        ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
        thy neck.

004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
        thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all
        spices!

004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
        are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.

004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
        fountain sealed.

004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
        fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
        frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
        from Lebanon.

004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
        garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
        come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
        gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
        with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
        friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved
        that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
        dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my
        locks with the drops of the night.

005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
        my feet; how shall I defile them?

005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my
        bowels were moved for him.

005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with
        myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
        handles of the lock.

005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
        and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
        I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
        they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
        from me.

005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
        that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
        among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
        that thou dost so charge us?

005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
        thousand.

005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and
        black as a raven.

005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
        washed with milk, and fitly set.

005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
        like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is
        as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
        gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is
        my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
        whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
        thee.

006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
        spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
        the lilies.

006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
        terrible as an army with banners.

006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
        hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the
        washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
        barren among them.

006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
        virgins without number.

006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
        mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The
        daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the
        concubines, and they praised her.

006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the
        moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
        valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the
        pomegranates budded.

006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
        Amminadib.

006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
        upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the
        company of two armies.

007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
        the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the
        hands of a cunning workman.

007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
        thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
        in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the
        tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine
        head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
        clusters of grapes.

007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
        boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
        the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
        that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
        asleep to speak.

007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge
        in the villages.

007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
        flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the
        pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
        pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O
        my beloved.

008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
        mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
        yea, I should not be despised.

008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
        would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
        of the juice of my pomegranate.

008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand
        should embrace me.

008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
        nor awake my love, until he please.

008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon
        her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy
        mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that
        bare thee.

008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
        for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
        the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
        vehement flame.

008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
        it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for
        love, it would utterly be contemned.

008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall
        we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
        and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
        cedar.

008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
        eyes as one that found favour.

008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard
        unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
        thousand pieces of silver.

008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon,
        must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof
        two hundred.

008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
        thy voice: cause me to hear it.

008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a
        young hart upon the mountains of spices.

Book 23	Isaiah

001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
        Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath
        spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they
        have rebelled against me.

001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
        Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
        evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
        the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
        anger, they are gone away backward.

001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and
        more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
        soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
        sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
        mollified with ointment.

001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire:
        your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
        desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
        as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
        remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
        like unto Gomorrah.

001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
        the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
        saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
        the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
        bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
        your hand, to tread my courts?

001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
        me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
        cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
        are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
        from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
        your hands are full of blood.

001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
        from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
        the fatherless, plead for the widow.

001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
        your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
        though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
        land:

001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
        sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
        judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
        one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not
        the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
        them.

001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
        Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
        of mine enemies:

001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
        dross, and take away all thy tin:

001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
        counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be
        called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
        righteousness.

001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
        shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be
        consumed.

001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
        and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
        chosen.

001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
        that hath no water.

001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a
        spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall
        quench them.

002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
        Jerusalem.

002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
        of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
        mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
        nations shall flow unto it.

002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
        the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
        paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
        people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
        their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
        against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
        LORD.

002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
        because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
        like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
        children of strangers.

002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
        any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots:

002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
        their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
        himself: therefore forgive them not.

002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
        the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
        exalted in that day.

002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
        is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
        he shall be brought low:

002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
        up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
        are lifted up,

002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
        pictures.

002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
        haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
        be exalted in that day.

002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
        caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
        his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
        idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to
        worship, to the moles and to the bats;

002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
        ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his
        majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for
        wherein is he to be accounted of ?

003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
        Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
        stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
        prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
        counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
        orator.

003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
        rule over them.

003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
        every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
        proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
        honourable.

003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
        father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
        this ruin be under thy hand:

003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
        ruler of the people.

003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
        tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the
        eyes of his glory.

003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
        they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto
        their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
        they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
        of his hands shall be given him.

003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
        rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee
        to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
        people.

003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
        people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
        vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
        faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
        haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
        walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with
        their feet:

003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the
        head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover
        their secret parts.

003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
        tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and
        their round tires like the moon,

003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
        and the tablets, and the earrings,

003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
        wimples, and the crisping pins,

003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
        shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of
        well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding
        of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
        shall sit upon the ground.

004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
        saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:
        only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
        glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
        comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
        he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
        every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
        daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
        Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment,
        and by the spirit of burning.

004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
        Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and
        the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
        shall be a defence.

004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time
        from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert
        from storm and from rain.

005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
        touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a
        very fruitful hill:

005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
        planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
        midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
        that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
        grapes.

005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
        I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
        done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
        forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
        I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
        and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
        but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for
        judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold
        a cry.

005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
        field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone
        in the midst of the earth!

005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
        shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
        of an homer shall yield an ephah.

005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
        follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
        inflame them!

005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,
        are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,
        neither consider the operation of his hands.

005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
        no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their
        multitude dried up with thirst.

005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
        without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and
        their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
        shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
        that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
        places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
        as it were with a cart rope:

005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may
        see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
        nigh and come, that we may know it!

005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
        darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter
        for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
        their own sight!

005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
        strength to mingle strong drink:

005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
        righteousness of the righteous from him!

005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
        consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
        their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
        the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the
        Holy One of Israel.

005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
        and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath
        smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
        were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
        will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold,
        they shall come with speed swiftly:

005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
        hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
        whirlwind:

005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
        lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
        shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
        of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
        sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting
        upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
        temple.

006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
        twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
        and with twain he did fly.

006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
        LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
        cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
        lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
        his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
        altar:

006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
        thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
        purged.

006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
        understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
        with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,
        and be healed.

006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities
        be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and
        the land be utterly desolate,

006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
        forsaking in the midst of the land.

006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall
        be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in
        them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be
        the substance thereof.

007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
        son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
        confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
        heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with
        the wind.

007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
        thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
        the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
        be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
        for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
        Remaliah.

007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
        evil counsel against thee, saying,

007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
        breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even
        the son of Tabeal:

007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it
        come to pass.

007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
        Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
        broken, that it be not a people.

007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
        Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
        established.

007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
        depth, or in the height above.

007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
        thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
        virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
        Immanuel.

007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
        evil, and choose the good.

007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
        the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
        both her kings.

007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
        thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
        Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
        of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
        desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
        thorns, and upon all bushes.

007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
        hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of
        Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also
        consume the beard.

007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
        nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
        shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall
        every one eat that is left in the land.

007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall
        be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
        silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all
        the land shall become briers and thorns.

007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
        shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it
        shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
        of lesser cattle.

008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
        write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
        priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
        son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
        Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
        and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
        shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
        go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
        waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
        Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
        channels, and go over all his banks:

008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
        over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out
        of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
        pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird
        yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves,
        and ye shall be broken in pieces.

008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
        word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
        instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
        people, saying,

008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people
        shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
        afraid.

008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
        and let him be your dread.

008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
        and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
        gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
        and be snared, and be taken.

008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
        house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
        signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth in mount Zion.

008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
        familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
        should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
        dead?

008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
        to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and
        it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they
        shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and
        look upward.

008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
        darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to
        darkness.

009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
        vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
        Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
        grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
        in Galilee of the nations.

009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
        they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
        hath the light shined.

009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
        they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
        men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
        his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of
        Midian.

009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
        garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
        fuel of fire.

009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
        government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
        called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
        Father, The Prince of Peace.

009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
        end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
        it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
        henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
        perform this.

009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
        Israel.

009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant
        of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
        stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them
        into cedars.

009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
        against him, and join his enemies together;

009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
        devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither
        do they seek the LORD of hosts.

009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        branch and rush, in one day.

009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
        that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
        that are led of them are destroyed.

009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men,
        neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
        every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
        speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
        his hand is stretched out still.

009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
        and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
        and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
        and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
        spare his brother.

009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
        shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied:
        they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together
        shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned
        away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
        grievousness which they have prescribed;

010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
        right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their
        prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
        desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
        help? and where will ye leave your glory?

010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
        shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
        is mine indignation.

010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against
        the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
        spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
        mire of the streets.

010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
        few.

010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not
        Samaria as Damascus?

010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
        graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
        to Jerusalem and her idols?

010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
        performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I
        will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
        Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and
        by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
        of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
        down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and
        as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the
        earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
        mouth, or peeped.

010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
        or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
        as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it
        up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no
        wood.

010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
        fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a
        burning like the burning of a fire.

010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day;

010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
        field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
        standard-bearer fainteth.

010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
        child may write them.

010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
        Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall
        no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay
        upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
        mighty God.

010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
        remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall
        overflow with righteousness.

010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
        determined, in the midst of all the land.

010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
        dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall
        smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
        thee, after the manner of Egypt.

010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
        and mine anger in their destruction.

010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
        according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
        as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
        manner of Egypt.

010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall
        be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
        neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
        anointing.

010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
        hath laid up his carriages:

010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
        lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
        unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
        themselves to flee.

010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
        hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
        Jerusalem.

010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
        terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
        the haughty shall be humbled.

010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
        a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of
        wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
        spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
        LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
        neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
        with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
        earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his
        lips shall he slay the wicked.

011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
        faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
        lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
        fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
        lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
        the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
        the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
        waters cover the sea.

011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
        stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
        seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
        his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
        people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
        from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
        and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
        assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
        dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
        Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
        Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
        toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together:
        they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children
        of Ammon shall obey them.

011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
        sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the
        river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men
        go over dryshod.

011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
        which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
        the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
        though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,
        and thou comfortedst me.

012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
        for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
        become my salvation.

012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
        salvation.

012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
        name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that
        his name is exalted.

012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
        known in all the earth.

012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the
        Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
        unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
        the nobles.

013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
        mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
        highness.

013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
        people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
        together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
        LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
        land.

013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as
        a destruction from the Almighty.

013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart
        shall melt:

013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
        them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
        shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
        flames.

013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
        fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
        the sinners thereof out of it.

013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
        not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
        forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
        their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
        cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
        than the golden wedge of Ophir.

013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
        out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in
        the day of his fierce anger.

013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
        taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
        flee every one into his own land.

013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
        that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their
        eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
        regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
        shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall
        not spare children.

013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
        Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah.

013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
        generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
        there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
        houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
        dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
        houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is
        near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
        Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers
        shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house
        of Jacob.

014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
        and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
        LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
        captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
        their oppressors.

014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
        thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the
        hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
        Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden
        city ceased!

014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre
        of the rulers.

014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
        that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
        hindereth.

014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
        into singing.

014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
        saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against
        us.

014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
        coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief
        ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all
        the kings of the nations.

014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
        weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy
        viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
        thee.

014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
        morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
        weaken the nations!

014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
        upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
        the most High.

014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
        pit.

014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
        thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
        that did shake kingdoms;

014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
        thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,
        every one in his own house.

014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
        and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through
        with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
        carcase trodden under feet.

014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
        hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of
        evildoers shall never be renowned.

014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
        fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
        the face of the world with cities.

014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
        cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
        nephew, saith the LORD.

014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
        water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
        thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
        shall it stand:

014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
        mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart
        from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
        this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
        it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
        smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come
        forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
        serpent.

014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
        lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and
        he shall slay thy remnant.

014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
        dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and
        none shall be alone in his appointed times.

014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
        the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
        trust in it.

015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
        waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of
        Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to
        weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their
        heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
        the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one
        shall howl, weeping abundantly.

015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
        even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall
        cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
        Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
        Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of
        Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
        withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
        have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the
        willows.

015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the
        howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto
        Beerelim.

015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will
        bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
        and upon the remnant of the land.

016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
        wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the
        nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
        in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
        that wandereth.

016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
        them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at
        an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out
        of the land.

016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
        upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
        seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of
        his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies
        shall not be so.

016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
        the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are
        stricken.

016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah:
        the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
        thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through
        the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
        over the sea.

016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
        Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and
        Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
        harvest is fallen.

016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
        field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
        shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
        in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and
        mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary
        on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
        pray; but he shall not prevail.

016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
        since that time.

016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
        the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
        contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant
        shall be very small and feeble.

017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
        being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
        glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
        shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
        lean.

017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
        reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
        gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
        olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost
        bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,
        saith the LORD God of Israel.

017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
        have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
        neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either
        the groves, or the images.

017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
        and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the
        children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
        not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt
        thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
        slips:

017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the
        morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest
        shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like
        the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
        make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but
        God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall
        be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
        like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he
        is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot
        of them that rob us.

018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the
        rivers of Ethiopia:

018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to
        a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
        beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
        land the rivers have spoiled!

018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
        see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
        when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
        consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs,
        and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
        grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the
        sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the
        branches.

018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
        and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer
        upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
        them.

018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of
        hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
        terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
        trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
        place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
        cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall
        be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in
        the midst of it.

019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
        shall fight every one against his brother, and every one
        against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
        kingdom.

019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
        will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
        idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
        spirits, and to the wizards.

019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
        lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord,
        the LORD of hosts.

019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
        wasted and dried up.

019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
        defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
        shall wither.

019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
        every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
        and be no more.

019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
        into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon
        the waters shall languish.

019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
        networks, shall be confounded.

019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
        make sluices and ponds for fish.

019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
        counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
        Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
        now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed
        upon Egypt.

019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
        deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the
        stay of the tribes thereof.

019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
        and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
        drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
        tail, branch or rush, may do.

019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
        afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD
        of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
        that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
        because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath
        determined against it.

019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
        language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall
        be called, The city of destruction.

019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to
        the LORD.

019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
        hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD
        because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour,
        and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
        know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
        oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform
        it.

019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it:
        and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be
        intreated of them, and shall heal them.

019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
        Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
        Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt
        my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine
        inheritance.

020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
        king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
        it;

020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
        off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
        barefoot.

020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
        and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and
        upon Ethiopia;

020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
        prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked
        and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame
        of Egypt.

020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
        expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
        such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
        delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
        south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a
        terrible land.

021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
        dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O
        Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to
        cease.

021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
        upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed
        down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
        pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise,
        ye princes, and anoint the shield.

021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
        him declare what he seeth.

021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
        asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
        with much heed:

021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
        watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole
        nights:

021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
        horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is
        fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken
        unto the ground.

021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
        heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
        unto you.

021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
        what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if
        ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
        lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
        was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
        the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according
        to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall
        fail:

021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
        the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God
        of Israel hath spoken it.

022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
        thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city:
        thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in
        battle.

022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
        archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
        have fled from far.

022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
        labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
        daughter of my people.

022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
        perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
        breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,
        and Kir uncovered the shield.

022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
        full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
        array at the gate.

022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
        in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
        are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
        pool.

022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
        have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
        the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
        neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
        to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
        eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to
        morrow we shall die.

022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
        this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith
        the Lord GOD of hosts.

022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
        treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
        hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a
        sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself
        in a rock?

022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
        and will surely cover thee.

022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
        large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of
        thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
        shall he pull thee down.

022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
        servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
        thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand:
        and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
        to the house of Judah.

022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
        shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
        shut, and none shall open.

022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall
        be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
        house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
        quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
        flagons.

022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
        fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and
        fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for
        the LORD hath spoken it.

023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
        waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
        land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
        of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
        river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
        strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
        children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up
        virgins.

023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely
        pained at the report of Tyre.

023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?
        her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the
        honourable of the earth?

023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
        glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
        earth.

023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
        there is no more strength.

023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
        the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city,
        to destroy the strong holds thereof.

023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
        virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
        also shalt thou have no rest.

023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till
        the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
        they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces
        thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
        forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
        after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
        forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou
        mayest be remembered.

023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
        the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and
        shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world
        upon the face of the earth.

023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the
        LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her
        merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to
        eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
        and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
        inhabitants thereof.

024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
        with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so
        with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
        with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
        usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
        the LORD hath spoken this word.

024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
        fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
        because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
        ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
        dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
        earth are burned, and few men left.

024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
        merryhearted do sigh.

024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
        endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
        bitter to them that drink it.

024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.

024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
        darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
        destruction.

024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
        people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as
        the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
        majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of
        the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
        glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,
        woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
        yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
        of the earth.

024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise
        of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out
        of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
        windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the
        earth do shake.

024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
        dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
        removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
        heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
        kings of the earth upon the earth.

024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many
        days shall they be visited.

024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
        the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
        and before his ancients gloriously.

025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
        name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
        are faithfulness and truth.

025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
        ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
        built.

025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
        the terrible nations shall fear thee.

025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
        needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from
        the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm
        against the wall.

025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
        dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
        branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
        people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
        fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
        cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
        nations.

025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
        wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
        people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD
        hath spoken it.

025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
        waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
        waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
        shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down
        for the dunghill.

025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
        he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he
        shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
        hands.

025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
        down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
        have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
        bulwarks.

026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
        truth may enter in.

026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
        thee: because he trusteth in thee.

026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
        everlasting strength:

026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
        he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he
        bringeth it even to the dust.

026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
        the steps of the needy.

026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
        weigh the path of the just.

026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
        thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
        remembrance of thee.

026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
        spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy
        judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
        learn righteousness.

026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
        righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
        unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
        shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea,
        the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast
        wrought all our works in us.

026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
        us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
        shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
        them, and made all their memory to perish.

026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
        the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
        all the ends of the earth.

026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
        prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
        delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we
        been in thy sight, O LORD.

026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
        were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
        fallen.

026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
        arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is
        as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
        doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
        until the indignation be overpast.

026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
        inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
        shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
        shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan
        that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in
        the sea.

027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
        hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against
        me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
        together.

027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace
        with me; and he shall make peace with me.

027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
        shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
        fruit.

027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is
        he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by
        him?

027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it:
        he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
        this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all
        the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in
        sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
        forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf
        feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches
        thereof.

027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken
        off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people
        of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
        mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no
        favour.

027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of
        Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of
        Israel.

027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
        shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish
        in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
        and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
        glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of
        the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
        tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
        waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
        hand.

028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
        under feet:

028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat
        valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit
        before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,
        while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,
        and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
        and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
        drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have
        erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine,
        they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
        vision, they stumble in judgment.

028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
        is no place clean.

028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
        understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and
        drawn from the breasts.

028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
        upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
        this people.

028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
        weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not
        hear.

028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
        precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
        little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall
        backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that
        rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
        with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
        shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have
        made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
        ourselves:

028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
        foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a
        sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
        plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
        the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
        agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing
        scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by
        it.

028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
        morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
        and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
        it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in
        it.

028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
        wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
        strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
        strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a
        consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
        the clods of his ground?

028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
        abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the
        principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
        place?

028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
        him.

028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
        fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
        rod.

028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
        it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
        with his horsemen.

028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
        wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
        year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
        sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
        against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against
        thee.

029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
        ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
        voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of
        the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
        dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff
        that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and
        with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
        the flame of devouring fire.

029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
        distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold,
        he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a
        thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
        awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite:
        so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight
        against mount Zion.

029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
        drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
        drink.

029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
        sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your
        rulers, the seers hath he covered.

029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
        book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
        saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
        is sealed:

029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying,
        Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
        with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
        removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
        taught by the precept of men:

029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
        among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for
        the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
        understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
        LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
        us? and who knoweth us?

029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as
        the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
        He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that
        framed it, He had no understanding?

029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
        esteemed as a forest?

029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and
        the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
        darkness.

029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the
        poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
        consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
        him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
        thing of nought.

029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
        concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
        neither shall his face now wax pale.

029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
        midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
        Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
        and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
        counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
        not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
        mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
        trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
        Hanes.

030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
        nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
        trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion,
        the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their
        riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures
        upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
        them.

030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
        therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
        sit still.

030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
        book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
        that will not hear the law of the LORD:

030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
        not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
        prophesy deceits:

030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
        Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and stay thereon:

030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
        fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh
        suddenly at an instant.

030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
        that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there
        shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
        from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
        returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
        confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
        ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
        they that pursue you be swift.

030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
        five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top
        of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
        you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
        upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
        they that wait for him.

030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
        weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
        of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
        water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
        into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
        the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
        when ye turn to the left.

030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
        silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou
        shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say
        unto it, Get thee hence.

030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
        the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and
        it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle
        feed in large pastures.

030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
        shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
        shovel and with the fan.

030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
        high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
        great slaughter, when the towers fall.

030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
        sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
        of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach
        of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
        anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
        indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
        midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
        vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,
        causing them to err.

030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
        kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to
        come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of
        Israel.

030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
        shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation
        of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with
        scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
        down, which smote with a rod.

030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
        the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and
        harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
        prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
        fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
        brimstone, doth kindle it.

031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
        horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in
        horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
        the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
        back his words: but will arise against the house of the
        evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses
        flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his
        hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
        shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
        the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
        shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid
        of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so
        shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
        for the hill thereof.

031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
        defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
        preserve it.

031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
        revolted.

031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
        and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
        for a sin.

031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
        man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
        he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
        discomfited.

031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
        princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose
        fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in judgment.

032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
        covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
        the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
        of them that hear shall hearken.

032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
        tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
        said to be bountiful.

032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
        work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
        against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
        will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
        devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
        needy speaketh right.

032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
        shall he stand.

032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
        daughters; give ear unto my speech.

032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
        for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
        ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon
        your loins.

032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
        the fruitful vine.

032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers;
        yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
        city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
        ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
        wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
        counted for a forest.

032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
        remain in the fruitful field.

032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
        sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
        shall be low in a low place.

032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
        thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and
        dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
        thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
        and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
        shall deal treacherously with thee.

033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
        their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
        trouble.

033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
        of thyself the nations were scattered.

033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
        caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
        upon them.

033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
        Zion with judgment and righteousness.

033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
        and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his
        treasure.

033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
        of peace shall weep bitterly.

033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
        broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth
        no man.

033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and
        hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
        shake off their fruits.

033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now
        will I lift up myself.

033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
        breath, as fire, shall devour you.

033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
        up shall they be burned in the fire.

033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
        near, acknowledge my might.

033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
        hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
        who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
        despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
        holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
        blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
        munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
        be sure.

033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
        the land that is very far off.

033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where
        is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper
        speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
        thou canst not understand.

033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
        see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not
        be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
        removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
        rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
        neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD
        is our king; he will save us.

033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
        mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a
        great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
        dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
        the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
        things that come forth of it.

034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his
        fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
        hath delivered them to the slaughter.

034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come
        up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
        with their blood.

034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
        shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall
        fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
        falling fig from the fig tree.

034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
        down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to
        judgment.

034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat
        with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
        fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
        Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
        with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
        their dust made fat with fatness.

034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
        recompences for the controversy of Zion.

034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the
        dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
        burning pitch.

034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
        shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall
        lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
        also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out
        upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
        shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles
        in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
        dragons, and a court for owls.

034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
        beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
        the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a
        place of rest.

034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch,
        and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be
        gathered, every one with her mate.

034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
        shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath
        commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided
        it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
        generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
        and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
        singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
        excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of
        the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
        behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
        recompence; he will come and save you.

035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
        the deaf shall be unstopped.

035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
        dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
        streams in the desert.

035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
        land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
        each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
        called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over
        it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
        fools, shall not err therein.

035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
        thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
        walk there:

035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
        with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
        obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
        away.

036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
        defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
        Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood
        by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
        fuller's field.

036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
        over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son,
        the recorder.

036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have
        counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
        that thou rebellest against me?

036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
        whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
        it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
        he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
        away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
        before this altar?

036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou
        be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to
        destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
        and destroy it.

036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
        pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
        understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
        the ears of the people that are on the wall.

036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
        to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
        that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
        drink their own piss with you?

036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the
        king of Assyria.

036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you.

036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
        into the hand of the king of Assyria.

036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me:
        and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
        tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will
        deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
        land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
        Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have
        delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
        the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph,
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
        sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
        are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
        forth.

037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
        living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God
        hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
        is left.

037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
        heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
        blasphemed me.

037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
        fall by the sword in his own land.

037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
        come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he
        sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
        Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
        Assyria.

037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
        delivered?

037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Telassar?

037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the
        cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
        kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
        and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
        sent to reproach the living God.

037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
        nations, and their countries,

037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
        the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD,
        even thou only.

037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
        against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
        The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and
        laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
        her head at thee.

037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
        By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of
        the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
        the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and
        I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of
        his Carmel.

037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
        have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of
        ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
        mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
        springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
        and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
        for my servant David's sake.

037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
        of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
        and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
        all dead corpses.

037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
        and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
        prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
        the LORD,

038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have
        walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
        done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
        thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
        behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
        king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the
        LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is
        gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
        the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone
        down.

038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and was recovered of his sickness:

038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
        of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land
        of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
        of the world.

038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
        tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off
        with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an
        end of me.

038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
        my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
        dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am
        oppressed; undertake for me.

038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself
        hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness
        of my soul.

038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is
        the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to
        live.

038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in
        love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for
        thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
        thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
        truth.

038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this
        day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
        to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
        house of the LORD.

038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
        for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
        the house of the LORD?

039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of
        his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
        and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour,
        and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
        his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them
        not.

039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me,
        even from Babylon.

039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is
        nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of
        hosts:

039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
        shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
        LORD.

039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
        peace and truth in my days.

040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for
        she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
        way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our
        God.

040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
        shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
        the rough places plain:

040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
        shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
        it.

040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
        is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
        the field:

040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of
        the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
        God shall stand for ever.

040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
        mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
        voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
        cities of Judah, Behold your God!

040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
        shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
        work before him.

040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
        lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
        gently lead those that are with young.

040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
        meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of
        the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?

040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
        counsellor hath taught him?

040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
        him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
        shewed to him the way of understanding?

040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
        as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the
        isles as a very little thing.

040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
        sufficient for a burnt offering.

040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
        him less than nothing, and vanity.

040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
        compare unto him?

040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
        spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
        tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
        to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
        you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
        foundations of the earth?

040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
        inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
        the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
        dwell in:

040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
        the earth as vanity.

040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
        yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
        shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
        whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
        Holy One.

040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
        things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth
        them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he
        is strong in power; not one faileth.

040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
        hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
        God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
        not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
        understanding.

040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
        he increaseth strength.

040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
        shall utterly fall:

040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
        they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and
        not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
        their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let
        us come near together to judgment.

041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to
        his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over
        kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven
        stubble to his bow.

041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he
        had not gone with his feet.

041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
        beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were
        afraid, drew near, and came.

041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
        brother, Be of good courage.

041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that
        smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
        is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that
        it should not be moved.

041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend.

041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
        thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art
        my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
        thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
        will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
        ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
        that strive with thee shall perish.

041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
        contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as
        nothing, and as a thing of nought.

041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
        thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
        thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of
        Israel.

041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument
        having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
        small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
        the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in
        the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
        their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
        the God of Israel will not forsake them.

041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
        of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.

041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
        and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
        fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
        together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
        Holy One of Israel hath created it.

041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
        reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
        them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
        consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
        things for to come.

041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
        that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be
        dismayed, and behold it together.

041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
        abomination is he that chooseth you.

041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from
        the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall
        come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth
        clay.

041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
        beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is
        none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea,
        there is none that heareth your words.

041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
        give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
        was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
        word.

041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
        molten images are wind and confusion.

042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
        delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
        forth judgment to the Gentiles.

042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
        in the street.

042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
        he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
        judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
        stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
        which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
        upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
        thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
        of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
        prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
        to another, neither my praise to graven images.

042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
        I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
        therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
        the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
        the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
        the islands.

042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
        jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
        prevail against his enemies.

042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
        refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
        will destroy and devour at once.

042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
        herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up
        the pools.

042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
        lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
        things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
        trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are
        our gods.

042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
        sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the
        LORD's servant?

042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
        but he heareth not.

042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
        magnify the law, and make it honourable.

042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
        snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
        for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
        Restore.

042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
        for the time to come?

042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
        the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
        walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
        the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round
        about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not
        to heart.

043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
        that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
        thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
        through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
        walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
        shall the flame kindle upon thee.

043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
        Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
        thee.

043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
        honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men
        for thee, and people for thy life.

043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
        east, and gather thee from the west;

043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
        back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends
        of the earth;

043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created
        him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
        have ears.

043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
        be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us
        former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they
        may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
        have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
        that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
        there be after me.

043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
        was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
        saith the LORD, that I am God.

043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
        deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
        For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
        all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
        ships.

043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
        King.

043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;

043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
        power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
        are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
        of old.

043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
        shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
        wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
        owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in
        the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
        praise.

043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
        weary of me, O Israel.

043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
        offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
        I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied
        thee with incense.

043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
        thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
        made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
        thine iniquities.

043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
        own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
        that thou mayest be justified.

043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
        transgressed against me.

043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
        have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
        chosen:

044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
        womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
        thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
        upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
        my blessing upon thine offspring:

044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
        water courses.

044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself
        by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
        hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
        LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
        me there is no God.

044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
        order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
        things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto
        them.

044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
        time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
        a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and
        their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
        own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
        ashamed.

044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
        profitable for nothing?

044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen,
        they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them
        stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
        together.

044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
        fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength
        of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he
        drinketh no water, and is faint.

044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with
        a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with
        the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man,
        according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the
        house.

044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
        which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
        forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
        and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,
        he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven
        image, and falleth down thereto.

044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
        eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
        warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
        fire:

044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven
        image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
        prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
        eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
        understand.

044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
        nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
        fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I
        have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue
        thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
        tree?

044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
        that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie
        in my right hand?

044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
        have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt
        not be forgotten of me.

044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
        as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
        thee.

044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
        parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
        forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed
        Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
        from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that
        stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
        earth by myself;

044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
        mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their
        knowledge foolish;

044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
        counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
        be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built,
        and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
        my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
        and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
        hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
        loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
        gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I
        will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
        bars of iron:

045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
        riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
        LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
        even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though
        thou hast not known me.

045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
        me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
        west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
        is none else.

045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
        create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
        righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth
        salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
        LORD have created it.

045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
        strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
        him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
        no hands?

045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
        or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
        Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
        the work of my hands command ye me.

045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
        hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
        I commanded.

045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
        his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
        captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
        Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
        unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after
        thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down
        unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
        Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no
        God.

045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
        the Saviour.

045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
        shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
        salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
        without end.

045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
        that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
        created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
        LORD; and there is none else.

045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
        said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
        LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
        escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the
        wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
        save.

045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
        together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath
        told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
        God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none
        beside me.

045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
        I am God, and there is none else.

045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
        righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee
        shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
        strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
        incensed against him shall be ashamed.

045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and
        shall glory.

046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
        beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden;
        they are a burden to the weary beast.

046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
        burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
        house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which
        are carried from the womb:

046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will
        I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
        and will deliver you.

046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
        that we may be like?

046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the
        balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they
        fall down, yea, they worship.

046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him
        in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
        remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer,
        nor save him out of his trouble.

046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to
        mind, O ye transgressors.

046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
        none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
        the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
        stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth
        my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will
        also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
        righteousness:

046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
        salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion
        for Israel my glory.

047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
        sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and
        delicate.

047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
        bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
        seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
        man.

047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy
        One of Israel.

047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
        kingdoms.

047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
        and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy;
        upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou
        didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
        remember the latter end of it.

047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures,
        that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
        and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither
        shall I know the loss of children:

047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
        day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
        thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
        and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
        seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
        thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
        beside me.

047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
        whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
        shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come
        upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
        thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if
        so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest
        prevail.

047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
        astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
        stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon
        thee.

047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
        they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
        there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before
        it.

047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
        even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every
        one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
        of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
        which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the
        God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
        upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
        went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
        suddenly, and they came to pass.

048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
        iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it
        came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
        idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
        hath commanded them.

048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I
        have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
        things, and thou didst not know them.

048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
        the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
        Behold, I knew them.

048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
        time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
        wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
        transgressor from the womb.

048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
        will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have
        chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for
        how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory
        unto another.

048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
        the first, I also am the last.

048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
        right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,
        they stand up together.

048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
        declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
        pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
        him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
        secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
        I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
        am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
        leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
        peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
        the sea:

048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
        bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
        cut off nor destroyed from before me.

048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
        voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
        end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
        Jacob.

048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
        caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave
        the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
        The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
        mother hath he made mention of my name.

049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
        his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
        quiver hath he hid me;

049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
        will be glorified.

049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
        for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
        LORD, and my work with my God.

049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
        servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
        gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
        my God shall be my strength.

049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
        servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
        preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
        Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
        earth.

049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
        to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth,
        to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
        also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and
        the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
        and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will
        preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
        establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
        heritages;

049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
        are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
        and their pastures shall be in all high places.

049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
        sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
        them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
        be exalted.

049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
        north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
        singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
        and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
        forgotten me.

049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
        compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
        will I not forget thee.

049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
        walls are continually before me.

049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that
        made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
        themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
        LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
        ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
        destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
        inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far
        away.

049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
        other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait
        for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me
        these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
        captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up
        these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
        the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they
        shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
        carried upon their shoulders.

049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
        nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
        toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
        shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed
        that wait for me.

049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
        delivered?

049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall
        be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
        delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with
        thee, and I will save thy children.

049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
        and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet
        wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour
        and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's
        divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
        it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have
        ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother
        put away.

050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
        there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
        cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
        rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
        fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
        thirst.

050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
        their covering.

050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
        should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
        weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to
        hear as the learned.

050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
        neither turned away back.

050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
        plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
        spitting.

050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
        confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
        know that I shall not be ashamed.

050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
        us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
        me.

050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall
        condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
        shall eat them up.

050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
        of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
        let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
        about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
        sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
        ye shall lie down in sorrow.

051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
        seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
        the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:
        for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
        places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
        desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be
        found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
        for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
        to rest for a light of the people.

051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
        arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and
        on mine arm shall they trust.

051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
        beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
        earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
        therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be
        for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
        whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
        neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
        shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for
        ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
        the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it
        that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
        great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
        ransomed to pass over?

051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
        singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
        head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
        mourning shall flee away.

051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
        shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
        man which shall be made as grass;

051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
        the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
        feared continually every day because of the fury of the
        oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the
        fury of the oppressor?

051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
        should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
        roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee
        in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and
        lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art
        my people.

051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
        hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the
        dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
        brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
        hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
        thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the
        sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the
        streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of
        the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
