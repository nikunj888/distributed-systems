        before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
        did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
        were gone over:

004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
        LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
        for ever.

005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
        were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
        Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
        dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
        Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
        neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
        children of Israel.

005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
        knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
        time.

005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
        people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
        men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
        out of Egypt.

005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
        people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
        wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
        came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
        voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
        shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
        that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
        Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
        had not circumcised them by the way.

005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
        people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
        were whole.

005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
        reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
        place is called Gilgal unto this day.

005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
        passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
        plains of Jericho.

005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
        after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
        selfsame day.

005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
        old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
        any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
        that year.

005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
        lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
        over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
        went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
        adversaries?

005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
        now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
        worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
        servant?

005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
        shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
        holy. And Joshua did so.

006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
        Israel: none went out, and none came in.

006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
        hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
        valour.

006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
        about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
        rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
        with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
        trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
        the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
        shall ascend up every man straight before him.

006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
        them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
        bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
        and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
        that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
        and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
        trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
        going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
        shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
        word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
        then shall ye shout.

006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
        once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of the LORD.

006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
        trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
        came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
        blowing with the trumpets.

006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
        into the camp: so they did six days.

006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
        about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
        same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
        city seven times.

006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
        with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
        LORD hath given you the city.

006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
        therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
        and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
        messengers that we sent.

006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
        lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
        thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
        treasury of the LORD.

006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
        and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
        trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
        wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.

006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
        edge of the sword.

006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
        country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
        woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
        Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
        all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
        left them without the camp of Israel.

006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
        only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
        iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
        household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
        even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
        Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
        man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
        Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
        and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
        throughout all the country.

007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
        accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
        the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
        thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
        children of Israel.

007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
        Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
        Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
        thither; for they are but few.

007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
        men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
        they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
        smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
        people melted, and became as water.

007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
        face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
        elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
        brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
        content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
        before their enemies!

007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
        hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
        thou thus upon thy face?

007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
        the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
        and they have put it even among their own stuff.

007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
        enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
        they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
        except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
        to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
        accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
        stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
        thing from among you.

007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
        tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
        shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
        which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
        household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
        shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
        hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
        hath wrought folly in Israel.

007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
        their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
        the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
        man; and Zabdi was taken:

007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
        Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
        Judah, was taken.

007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
        to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
        tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
        against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
        two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
        shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
        behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
        the silver under it.

007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
        behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
        them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
        laid them out before the LORD.

007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
        Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
        brought them unto the valley of Achor.

007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
        trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
        and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
        stones.

007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
        So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
        the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
        this day.

008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
        dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
        up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
        his people, and his city, and his land:

008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
        Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
        thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
        ambush for the city behind it.

008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
        Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
        and sent them away by night.

008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
        against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
        the city, but be ye all ready:

008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
        the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
        against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
        the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
        first: therefore we will flee before them.

008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
        city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
        set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
        shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
        ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
        Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
        people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
        people to Ai.

008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
        went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
        on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
        and Ai.

008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
        ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
        on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
        of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
        valley.

008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
        hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
        against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
        appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
        liers in ambush against him behind the city.

008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
        them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
        pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
        drawn away from the city.

008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
        out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
        after Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
        in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
        Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
        the city.

008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
        as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
        into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
        fire.

008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
        behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
        had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
        fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
        the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
        turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
        were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
        that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
        remain or escape.

008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
        all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
        wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
        edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
        Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword.

008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
        women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
        the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
        of Ai.

008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
        prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
        which he commanded Joshua.

008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
        desolation unto this day.

008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
        soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
        take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
        entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
        heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
        mount Ebal,

008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
        Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
        altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
        iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.

008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
        judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
        priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
        half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
        against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
        commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
        and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
        the law.

008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
        women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
        conversant among them.

009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
        side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
        coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
        the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
        Jebusite, heard thereof;

009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.

009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        unto Jericho and to Ai,

009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
        ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
        bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
        upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
        mouldy.

009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
        him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
        now therefore make ye a league with us.

009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
        dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
        said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
        are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
        heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
        were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
        of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
        spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
        therefore now make ye a league with us.

009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
        is dry, and it is mouldy:

009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
        behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
        become old by reason of the very long journey.

009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
        the mouth of the LORD.

009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
        to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
        unto them.

009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
        made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
        neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
        cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
        Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
        Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
        sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
        may not touch them.

009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
        wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
        them.

009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
        hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
        as the princes had promised them.

009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
        Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
        you; when ye dwell among us?

009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
        freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the house of my God.

009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
        servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
        inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
        sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
        thing.

009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
        right unto thee to do unto us, do.

009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
        even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
        heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
        as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
        and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
        with Israel, and were among them;

010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
        one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men thereof were mighty.

010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
        of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
        king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
        hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
        Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
        of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
        and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
        Gibeon, and made war against it.

010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
        quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
        Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
        against us.

010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
        delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
        stand before thee.

010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
        Gilgal all night.

010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
        way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
        unto Makkedah.

010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
        in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
        stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
        were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
        children of Israel slew with the sword.

010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
        he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
        Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
        had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
        in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
        heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
        LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
        for Israel.

010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
        Makkedah.

010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
        in a cave at Makkedah.

010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it for to keep them:

010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
        hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
        for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
        had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
        till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
        entered into fenced cities.

010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
        in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
        Israel.

010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
        those five kings unto me out of the cave.

010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
        out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
        Eglon.

010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
        Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
        near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
        came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
        strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
        your enemies against whom ye fight.

010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
        them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
        the evening.

010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
        laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
        very day.

010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
        he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
        unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
        hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
        but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
        Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
        took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
        that he had done to Libnah.

010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        smote him and his people, until he had left him none
        remaining.

010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
        him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
        the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
        Lachish.

010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
        Hebron; and they fought against it:

010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
        the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
        souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
        all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
        all the souls that were therein.

010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
        fought against it:

010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
        thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
        utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
        none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
        and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
        her king.

010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
        south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
        kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
        breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
        all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
        time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
        things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
        of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
        of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
        the borders of Dor on the west,

011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
        Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
        in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
        of Mizpeh.

011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
        people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
        multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
        pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
        Israel.

011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
        for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
        chariots with fire.

011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
        them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
        them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
        Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
        they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
        their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
        the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
        head of all those kingdoms.

011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
        of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
        to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
        and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
        LORD commanded.

011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
        Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
        burn.

011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
        children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
        man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
        destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
        Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
        country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
        plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
        their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
        Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
        they took in battle.

011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
        should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
        them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
        might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
        mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
        the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
        Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
        of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
        remained.

011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
        said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
        Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
        land rested from war.

012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
        Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
        Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
        mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
        from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
        the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
        Ammon;

012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
        unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
        way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
        of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
        unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
        half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
        Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
        possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
        tribe of Manasseh.

012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
        children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
        that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
        Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
        in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
        country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
        Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
        Bethel, one;

012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
        nations of Gilgal, one;

012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
        unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
        remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
        Philistines, and all Geshuri,

013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
        Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
        of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
        Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
        Avites:

013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
        Amorites:

013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
        sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
        into Hamath.

013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
        Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
        from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
        unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
        thee.

013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
        nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
        inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
        even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
        city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
        Medeba unto Dibon;

013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
        reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
        and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
        these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
        Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
        Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
        sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
        inheritance, as he said unto them.

013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
        inheritance according to their families.

013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
        river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
        and all the plain by Medeba;

013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
        Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
        the valley,

013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
        smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
        Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
        country.

013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
        them.

013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
        border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
        Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
        thereof.

013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
        the children of Gad according to their families.

013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
        half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
        before Rabbah;

013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
        Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
        Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
        Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
        families, the cities, and their villages.

013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
        and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
        of Manasseh by their families.

013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
        Bashan, threescore cities:

013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
        kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
        Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
        children of Machir by their families.

013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
        inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
        by Jericho, eastward.

013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
        LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
        them.

014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
        inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
        to them.

014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
        hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
        tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
        none inheritance among them.

014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
        Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
        land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
        cattle and for their substance.

014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
        and they divided the land.

014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
        knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
        concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
        me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in mine heart.

014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
        children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
        LORD my God.

014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
        these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
        word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
        wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
        years old.

014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
        sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
        for war, both to go out, and to come in.

014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
        that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
        there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
        LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
        as the LORD said.

014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
        followed the LORD God of Israel.

014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
        a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
        their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
        Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
        from the bay that looketh southward:

015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
        passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
        Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
        and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
        river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
        sea: this shall be your south coast.

015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
        Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
        of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
        north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
        Bohan the son of Reuben:

015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
        going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
        and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
        goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
        the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
        border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
        the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
        valley of the giants northward:

015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
        fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
        of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
        Kirjathjearim:

015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
        and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
        Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
        passed on to Timnah:

015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
        the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
        Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
        border were at the sea.

015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
        thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
        about according to their families.

015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
        children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
        Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
        is Hebron.

015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
        Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
        name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
        Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
        south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
        upper springs, and the nether springs.

015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.

015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
        Jagur,

015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
        are twenty and nine, with their villages:

015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages:

015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
        cities with their villages:

015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
        villages:

015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
        their villages:

015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
        and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border thereof:

015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
        villages:

015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
        cities with their villages:

015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
        villages:

015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
        with their villages:

015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
        their villages.

015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
        children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
        dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
        Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
        wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
        borders of Archi to Ataroth,

016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
        coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
        out thereof are at the sea.

016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
        inheritance.

016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
        east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
        north side; and the border went about eastward unto
        Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
        came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
        Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
        inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
        families.

016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
        the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
        with their villages.

016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
        the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
        serve under tribute.

017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
        firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
        Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
        children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
        children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
        the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
        of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
        and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
        Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
        Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
        LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
        brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
        he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
        father.

017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
        Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
        sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
        lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
        hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
        border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
        river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
        Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
        the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
        the north, and in Issachar on the east.

017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
        towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
        the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
        inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
        that land.

017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
        strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
        utterly drive them out.

017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
        thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
        am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
        hitherto?

017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
        thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
        the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
        be too narrow for thee.

017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
        us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
        valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
        and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
        power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
        shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
        thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
        chariots, and though they be strong.

018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
        congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet received their inheritance.

018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
        slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
        fathers hath given you?

018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
        send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
        describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
        shall come again to me.

018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
        in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their coasts on the north.

018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
        bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
        you here before the LORD our God.

018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
        the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
        Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
        them.

018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
        went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
        land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
        cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
        to the host at Shiloh.

018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
        there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.

018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
        forth between the children of Judah and the children of
        Joseph.

018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
        border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
        went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
        thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
        of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
        to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
        the nether Bethhoron.

018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
        the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
        southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
        which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
        was the west quarter.

018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
        the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
        waters of Nephtoah:

018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
        before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
        valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
        of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
        to Enrogel,

018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
        went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
        of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
        Reuben,

018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
        northward, and went down unto Arabah:

018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
        northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
        bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
        south coast.

018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
        round about, according to their families.

018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
        the valley of Keziz,

018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
        their villages:

018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
        Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
        families.

019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
        the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
        inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
        Judah.

019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
        Moladah,

019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
        villages:

019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
        villages:

019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
        families.

019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
        inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
        children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
        children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
        inheritance of them.

019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
        according to their families: and the border of their
        inheritance was unto Sarid:

019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
        reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
        Jokneam;

019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
        border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
        goeth up to Japhia,

019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
        to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
        and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
        Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
        Issachar according to their families.

019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
        Shunem,

019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
        Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.

019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Asher according to their families.

019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
        Achshaph,

019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
        westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
        Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
        of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
        hand,

019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
        Zidon;

019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
        Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
        thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
        their villages.

019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.

019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
        Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
        thereof were at Jordan:

019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
        out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
        south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
        Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,

019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.

019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Dan according to their families.

019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
        Irshemesh,

019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
        them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
        Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.

019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
        by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
        Joshua the son of Nun among them:

019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
        he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
        city, and dwelt therein.

019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
        by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
        dividing the country.

020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
        cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
        Moses:

020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
        unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
        from the avenger of blood.

020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
        stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
        declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
        shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.

020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
        neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
        priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
        return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
        unto the city from whence he fled.

020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
        Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
        the mountain of Judah.

020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
        assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
        tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
        and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
        whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
        stood before the congregation.

021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
        Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
        the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
        Israel;

021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
        cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
        inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
        their suburbs.

021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
        the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
        families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
        the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
        of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
        Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
        of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
        of Zebulun, twelve cities.

021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
        cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
        of Moses.

021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
        out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
        are here mentioned by name.

021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
        Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
        was the first lot.

021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
        city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
        thereof round about it.

021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
        they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
        her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
        with her suburbs,

021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
        Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
        tribes.

021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
        Geba with her suburbs,

021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
        thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
        remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
        to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
        suburbs,

021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
        four cities.

021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
        Gibbethon with her suburbs,

021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
        suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
        the children of Kohath that remained.

021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
        Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
        Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
        the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
        Dabareh with her suburbs,

021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
        with her suburbs,

021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
        with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
        the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
        suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
        Jahazah with her suburbs,

021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
        with her suburbs,

021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
        in all.

021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
        families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
        were by their lot twelve cities.

021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
        children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
        suburbs.

021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
        them: thus were all these cities.

021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
        give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
        therein.

021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
        he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
        their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
        enemies into their hand.

021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
        spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
        half tribe of Manasseh,

022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
        commanded you:

022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
        God.

022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
        as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
        your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
        the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
        which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
        LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
        commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
        all your heart and with all your soul.

022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
        their tents.

022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
        Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
        when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
        blessed them,

022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
        your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
        gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
        raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
        children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
        Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
        possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
        land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
        and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
        a great altar to see to.

022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
        Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
        borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
        together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
        priest,

022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
        throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
        of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
        of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
        Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
        is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
        turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
        builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
        LORD?

022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
        not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
        the congregation of the LORD,

022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
        and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
        to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
        Israel.

022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
        wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
        among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
        us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
        God.

022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
        accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
        Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
        the thousands of Israel,

022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
        Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
        transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
        LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
        or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
        require it;

022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
        saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
        children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
        Israel?

022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
        children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
        LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
        fearing the LORD.

022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
        generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
        to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
        to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
        again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
        it is a witness between us and you.

022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
        this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
        offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
        altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
        congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
        with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
        children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
        them.

022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
        children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
        children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
        among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
        the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
        the hand of the LORD.

022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
        Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
        the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
        of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
        them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
        Reuben and Gad dwelt.

022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
        altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
        is God.

023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
        rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
        Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
        for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
        and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
        these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
        hath fought for you.

023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
        remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
        sea westward.

023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
        their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
        aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
        you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
        to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
        them:

023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
        day.

023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
        strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
        you unto this day.

023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
        he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
        LORD your God.

023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
        of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
        make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
        you:

023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
        out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
        snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
        thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
        which the LORD your God hath given you.

023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
        ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
        thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
        God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
        not one thing hath failed thereof.

023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
        come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
        the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
        destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
        hath given you.

023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
        which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
        and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
        be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he hath given unto you.

024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
        called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
        their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
        themselves before God.

024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
        in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
        of Nachor: and they served other gods.

024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
        flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
        multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
        mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
        down into Egypt.

024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
        sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
        chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
        and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
        them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
        ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
        on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
        them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
        destroyed them from before you.

024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
        against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
        curse you:

024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
        still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
        them into your hand.

024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
        before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
        thy sword, nor with thy bow.

024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
        cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
        vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
        truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
        other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
        this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
        fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
        the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
        me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
        forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
        fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
        through whom we passed:

024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
        Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
        the LORD; for he is our God.

024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
        he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your transgressions nor your sins.

024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
        turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
        you good.

024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
        LORD.

024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
        yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
        they said, We are witnesses.

024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
        serve, and his voice will we obey.

024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
        and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
        was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
        be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
        LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
        unto you, lest ye deny your God.

024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
        inheritance.

024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
        Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
        years old.

024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill of Gaash.

024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
        days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
        all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
        which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
        for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
        of the children of Joseph.

024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
        hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
        in mount Ephraim.

Book 07	Judges

001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
        children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
        us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.

001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
        my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
        likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
        him.

001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
        the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.

001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
        him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
        him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
        thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
        brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
        had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
        set the city on fire.

001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
        and in the valley.

001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
        Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
        the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
        it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
        ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
        me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
        her the upper springs and the nether springs.

001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
        the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
        they went and dwelt among the people.

001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
        Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        And the name of the city was called Hormah.

001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
        the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
        of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
        the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
        expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
        that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
        children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
        the LORD was with them.

001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)

001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
        city, and we will shew thee mercy.

001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
        and all his family.

001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
        city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
        thereof unto this day.

001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
        towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
        Canaanites would dwell in that land.

001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
        Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
        Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
        the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
        them, and became tributaries.

001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
        inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
        Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land: for they did not drive them out.

001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
        Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
        inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
        unto them.

001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
        for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
        Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
        that they became tributaries.

001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
        Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
        said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
        unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
        will never break my covenant with you.

002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
        ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
        voice: why have ye done this?

002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
        you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare unto you.

002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
        words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept.

002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
        sacrificed there unto the LORD.

002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
        went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
        the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
        being an hundred and ten years old.

002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill Gaash.

002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
        the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and served Baalim:

002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
        gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
        themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
        them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
        unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
        out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
        went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
        them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
        walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
        not so.

002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
        enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
        because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
        them and vexed them.

002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
        returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
        following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
        they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
        way.

002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
        Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
        the nations which Joshua left when he died:

002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
        it, or not.

002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
        out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
        Joshua.

003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
        of Canaan;

003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
        know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
        nothing thereof;

003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
        Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
        commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
        Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
        Jebusites:

003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
        groves.

003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
        Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
        Chushanrishathaim eight years.

003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
        them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
        Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
        Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
        hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
        Kenaz died.

003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
        Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
        went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
        eighteen years.

003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
        a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
        present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
        length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
        thigh.

003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
        was a very fat man.

003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
        the people that bare the present.

003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
        Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
        who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
        from him.

003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
        parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
        a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
        his belly; and the dirt came out.

003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
        the parlour upon him, and locked them.

003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
        that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
        Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
        opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
        key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
        dead on the earth.

003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
        quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
        in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the mount, and he before them.

003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
        delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
        went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
        and suffered not a man to pass over.

003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
        lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
        land had rest fourscore years.

003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
        Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
        delivered Israel.

004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
        LORD, when Ehud was dead.

004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
        which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
        nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
        oppressed the children of Israel.

004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.

004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
        Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
        her for judgment.

004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
        Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
        take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?

004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
        captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into thine hand.

004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
        go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
        journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
        the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
        Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
        up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
        him.

004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
        father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
        and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
        Kedesh.

004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
        up to mount Tabor.

004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
        hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
        him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
        the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
        LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
        Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
        his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
        Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
        feet.

004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
        Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
        upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
        wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
        my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
        unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
        drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
        gave him drink, and covered him.

004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
        shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
        Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
        hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
        nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
        was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
        him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
        whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
        Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
        children of Israel.

004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
        prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
        destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
        saying,

005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
        willingly offered themselves.

005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
        unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
        dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
        from before the LORD God of Israel.

005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
        through byways.

005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
        until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
        shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
        themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
        and walk by the way.

005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
        places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
        righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
        inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
        of the LORD go down to the gates.

005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
        Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
        among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
        mighty.

005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
        thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
        governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
        writer.

005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
        and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
        divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
        of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
        searchings of heart.

005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
        unto the death in the high places of the field.

005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
        against Sisera.

005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
        river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
        the pransings of their mighty ones.

005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
        the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
        the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
        be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
        butter in a lordly dish.

005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
        workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
        smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
        his temples.

005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
        bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
        the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
        the wheels of his chariots?

005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
        herself,

005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
        man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
        prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
        needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
        the spoil?

005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
        love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
        the land had rest forty years.

006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
        and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
        years.

006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
        of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
        which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
        up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
        they came up against them;

006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
        the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
        for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
        came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
        camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
        destroy it.

006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
        and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
        the LORD because of the Midianites,

006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
        which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
        house of bondage;

006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
        of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
        before you, and gave you their land;

006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
        of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
        obeyed my voice.

006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
        which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
        from the Midianites.

006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
        him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
        why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
        miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
        LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
        us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
        and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
        have not I sent thee?

006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
        Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
        least in my father's house.

006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
        thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
        then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
        bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
        will tarry until thou come again.

006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
        and presented it.

006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
        unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
        the broth. And he did so.

006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
        was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
        the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
        departed out of his sight.

006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
        Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
        angel of the LORD face to face.

006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
        shalt not die.

006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
        Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
        of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
        father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
        rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
        offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
        shalt cut down.

006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
        had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
        father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
        do it by day, that he did it by night.

006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
        behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
        the altar that was built.

006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
        when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
        Joash hath done this thing.

006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
        that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
        and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
        for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
        him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
        let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
        altar.

006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
        Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
        the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
        the valley of Jezreel.

006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
        trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
        gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
        unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
        them.

006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said,

006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
        dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
        beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said.

006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
        the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
        bowl full of water.

006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
        me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
        but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
        fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
        only, and there was dew on all the ground.

007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
        with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
        so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
        them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
        are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
        hath saved me.

007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
        saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
        depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
        people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
        thousand.

007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
        bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
        there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
        shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
        whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
        same shall not go.

007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
        said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
        tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
        likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
        their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
        people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
        lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
        hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
        place.

007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
        and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
        and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.

007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
        it into thine hand.

007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
        down to the host:

007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
        hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
        down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
        that were in the host.

007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
        multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
        by the sea side for multitude.

007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
        dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
        and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
        Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
        overturned it, that the tent lay along.

007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
        the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
        into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
        the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
        into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
        delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
        he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
        lamps within the pitchers.

007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
        behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
        that, as I do, so shall ye do.

007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
        blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
        say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
        the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
        and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
        trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
        pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
        trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
        The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
        every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
        host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
        border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
        Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
        pursued after the Midianites.

007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
        saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
        the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
        Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
        Bethbarah and Jordan.

007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
        the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
        heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
        thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
        with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
        you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?

008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
        their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
        of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
        and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
        Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
        thine army?

008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
        and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
        the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
        answered him.

008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
        again in peace, I will break down this tower.

008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
        them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
        the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
        hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
        the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
        host was secure.

008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
        took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
        discomfited all the host.

008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
        sun was up,

008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
        him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
        elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
        and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
        hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
        give bread unto thy men that are weary?

008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
        wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
        Succoth.

008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
        city.

008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
        were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
        mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
        would not slay you.

008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
        the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
        yet a youth.

008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
        as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
        Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
        their camels' necks.

008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
        both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
        delivered us from the hand of Midian.

008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
        shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
        that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
        they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
        spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
        of his prey.

008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
        thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
        and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
        Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
        necks.

008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
        in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
        which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
        they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
        quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
        house.

008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
        for he had many wives.

008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
        son, whose name he called Abimelech.

008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
        buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
        children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
        Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
        on every side:

008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shewed unto Israel.

009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
        mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
        family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
        Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
        Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
        you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
        bone and your flesh.

009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
        men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
        follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
        the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
        light persons, which followed him.

009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
        brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
        persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
        youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
        house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
        plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
        of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
        unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
        hearken unto you.

009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
        they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
        wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
        over the trees?

009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
        sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
        trees?

009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
        cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
        over us.

009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
        king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
        if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
        cedars of Lebanon.

009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
        have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
        Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
        the deserving of his hands;

009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
        have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
        stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
        with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
        him also rejoice in you:

009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
        men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
        from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
        devour Abimelech.

009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
        there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
        Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
        Abimelech:

009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
        Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
        their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
        which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
        the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
        them: and it was told Abimelech.

009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
        to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
        him.

009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
        vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
        the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
        Abimelech.

009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
        Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
        Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
        father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
        army, and come out.

009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
        Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
        behold, they fortify the city against thee.

009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
        thee, and lie in wait in the field:

009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
        up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
        when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
        then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
        by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
        companies.

009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
        of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        that were with him, from lying in wait.

009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
        come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
        unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
        were men.

009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
        the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
        plain of Meonenim.

009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
        thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
        not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
        now, and fight with them.

009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
        Abimelech.

009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
        were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
        gate.

009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
        his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
        into the field; and they told Abimelech.

009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
        people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
        them, and smote them.

009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
        forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
        and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
        in the fields, and slew them.

009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
        took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
        down the city, and sowed it with salt.

009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
        entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
        Shechem were gathered together.

009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
        people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
        hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
        laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
        with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
        have done.

009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
        followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
        on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        died also, about a thousand men and women.

009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.

009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
        to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
        went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
        Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
        and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
        not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
        through, and he died.

009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
        departed every man unto his place.

009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
        their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
        Jerubbaal.

010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
        of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
        Shamir in mount Ephraim.

010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.

010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
        twenty and two years.

010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.

010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
        and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
        the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
        forsook the LORD, and served not him.

010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
        the children of Ammon.

010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
        eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
        other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
        Gilead.

010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
        also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
        house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
        have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
        God, and also served Baalim.

010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
        deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
        the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
        oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
        their hand.

010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
        will deliver you no more.

010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
        deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
        do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
        only, we pray thee, this day.

010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
        the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
        encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
        themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
        man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
        Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
        was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
        and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
        not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
        strange woman.

011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
        Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
        out with him.

011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
        Ammon made war against Israel.

011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
        against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
        out of the land of Tob:

011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.

011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
        me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
        unto me now when ye are in distress?

011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
        again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
        against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
        inhabitants of Gilead.

011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
        home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
        witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
        his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
        Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
        come against me to fight in my land?

011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
        messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
        they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
        unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
        peaceably.

011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
        children of Ammon:

011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
        the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
        wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
        me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
        would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
        the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
        in Kadesh.

011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
        land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
        but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
        border of Moab.

011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
        pray thee, through thy land into my place.

011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
        Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.

011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
        into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
        possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
        that country.

011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
        even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
        to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
        from before us, them will we possess.

011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
        Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
        did he ever fight against them,

011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
        her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
        of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
        recover them within that time?

011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
        wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
        the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
        Ammon.

011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
        shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
        hands,

011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
        my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.

011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
        even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
        a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
        subdued before the children of Israel.

011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
        daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
        and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
        daughter.

011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
        clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
        very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
        opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
        mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
        proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
        vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
        Ammon.

011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
        let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
        mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
        went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
        mountains.

011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
        returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
        vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
        custom in Israel,

011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
        daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
        northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
        over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
        call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
        with fire.

012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
        strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
        delivered me not out of their hands.

012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
        hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
        up unto me this day, to fight against me?

012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
        fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
        because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
        among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
        Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
        were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
        unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
        Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
        they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
        there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
        thousand.

012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
        Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
        abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
        And he judged Israel seven years.

012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
        Israel ten years.

012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
        country of Zebulun.

012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
        Israel.

012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
        threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
        years.

012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
        buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
        Amalekites.

013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
        Philistines forty years.

013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
        Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
        bare not.

013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
        unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
        thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
        strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
        shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
        God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
        the hand of the Philistines.

013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
        came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
        an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
        was, neither told he me his name:

013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
        son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
        unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
        the womb to the day of his death.

013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
        man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
        us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
        came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
        her husband was not with her.

013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
        said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
        came unto me the other day.

013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
        man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
        woman? And he said, I am.

013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
        order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
        unto the woman let her beware.

013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
        let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
        all that I commanded her let her observe.

013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
        us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
        me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
        burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
        knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
        that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
        after my name, seeing it is secret?

013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
        a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
        Manoah and his wife looked on.

013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
        off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
        flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
        fell on their faces to the ground.

013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
        his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God.

013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
        us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
        offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
        these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
        things as these.

013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
        child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
        camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
        the daughters of the Philistines.

014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
        I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
        Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
        woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
        people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
        Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
        for she pleaseth me well.

014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
        LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
        at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
        Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
        young lion roared against him.

014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
        him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
        hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
        done.

014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
        Samson well.

014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
        to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
        of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
        to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
        but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
        carcase of the lion.

014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
        a feast; for so used the young men to do.

014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
        thirty companions to be with him.

014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
        you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
        of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments:

014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
        Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
        out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
        three days expound the riddle.

014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
        Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
        the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
        fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
        hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
        the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
        said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
        mother, and shall I tell it thee?

014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
        lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
        her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
        the children of her people.

014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
        before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
        is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
        plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
        Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
        and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
        riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
        father's house.

014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
        as his friend.

015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
        harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
        I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
        not suffer him to go in.

015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
        hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
        younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
        of her.

015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
        than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
        firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
        the midst between two tails.

015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
        the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
        shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
        olives.

015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
        answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
        had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
        Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
        I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
        went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
        themselves in Lehi.

015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
        they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
        he hath done to us.

015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
        Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
        Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
        done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
        have I done unto them.

015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
        may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
        said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
        yourselves.

015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
        fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
        kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
        him up from the rock.

015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
        him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
        the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
        burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
        and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
        with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
        he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
        place Ramathlehi.

015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
        Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
        servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
        hand of the uncircumcised?

015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
        came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
        again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
        Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
        years.

016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
        unto her.

016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
        And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
        the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
        the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
        the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
        away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
        and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
        Hebron.

016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
        valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
        unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
        lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
        may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
        of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
        great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
        afflict thee.

016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
        withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
        another man.

016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
        green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
        them.

016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
        chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
        Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
        when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
        told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
        mightest be bound.

016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
        never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
        man.

016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
        said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
        were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
        from off his arms like a thread.

016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
        and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
        And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
        head with the web.

016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
        Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
        sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
        web.

016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
        thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
        times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
        words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
        not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
        unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
        strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
        any other man.

016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
        sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
        up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
        lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
        in their hand.

016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
        man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
        head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
        him.

016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
        awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
        times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
        was departed from him.

016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
        and he did grind in the prison house.

016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
        shaven.

016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
        to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
        rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
        enemy into our hand.

016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
        said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
        destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
        said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
        called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
        sport: and they set him between the pillars.

016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
        me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
        that I may lean upon them.

016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
        the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
        three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
        sport.

016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
        remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
        this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
        Philistines for my two eyes.

016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
        house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
        right hand, and of the other with his left.

016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
        himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
        and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
        he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
        life.

016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
        and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
        judged Israel twenty years.

017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
        silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
        and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
        me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
        LORD, my son.

017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
        to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
        silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
        image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
        thee.

017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
        two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
        who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
        were in the house of Micah.

017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
        teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
        priest.

017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.

017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
        of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
        sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
        Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
        him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
        where I may find a place.

017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
        father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
        silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
        So the Levite went in.

017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
        young man was unto him as one of his sons.

017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
        priest, and was in the house of Micah.

017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
        in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
        unto them among the tribes of Israel.

018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
        their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
        spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
        Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
        the house of Micah, they lodged there.

018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
        the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
        unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
        this place? and what hast thou here?

018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
        and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
        that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
        prosperous.

018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
        your way wherein ye go.

018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
        people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
        manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
        magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
        thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
        business with any man.

018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
        their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
        have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
        still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
        land.

018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
        land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
        there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
        of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
        weapons of war.

018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
        wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
        behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
        house of Micah.

018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
        Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
        in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
        and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
        young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
        saluted him.

018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
        which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
        the gate.

018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
        came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
        the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
        appointed with weapons of war.

018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
        image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
        said the priest unto them, What do ye?

018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
        thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
        is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
        man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
        Israel?

018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
        the people.

018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
        cattle and the carriage before them.

018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
        that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
        together, and overtook the children of Dan.

018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
        faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
        with such a company?

018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
        priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
        is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
        heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
        lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
        unto his house.

018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
        which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
        quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
        sword, and burnt the city with fire.

018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
        they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
        that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
        therein.

018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
        Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
        of the city was Laish at the first.

018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
        the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
        priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
        the land.

018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
        the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
        Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
        of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
        Bethlehemjudah.

019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
        from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
        there four whole months.

019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
        unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
        and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
        house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
        to meet him.

019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
        he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
        lodged there.

019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
        in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
        father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
        morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
        together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
        content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
        be merry.

019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
        him: therefore he lodged there again.

019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
        and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
        thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
        of them.

019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
        his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
        him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
        tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
        here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
        early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
        departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
        there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
        with him.

019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
        servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
        turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
        into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
        Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
        one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
        Ramah.

019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
        upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
        Benjamin.

019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
        Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
        the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
        to lodging.

019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
        field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
        sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
        the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
        thou? and whence comest thou?

019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
        toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
        to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
        LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
        is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
        the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
        any thing.

019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
        thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
        asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
        the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
        and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
        house, that we may know him.

019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
        said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
        wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
        this folly.

019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
        I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
        what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
        thing.

019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
        concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
        and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
        day began to spring, they let her go.

019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
        at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
        light.

019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
        the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
        her hands were upon the threshold.

019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
        answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
        rose up, and gat him unto his place.

019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
        hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
        bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
        Israel.

019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
        deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
        came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
        it, take advice, and speak your minds.

020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
        was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
        Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
        God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
        Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
        Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
        answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
        Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
        round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
        and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
        they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
        and counsel.

020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
        of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
        house.

020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
        will go up by lot against it;

020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
        tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
        out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
        they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
        to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
        together as one man.

020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
        Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
        you?

020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
        which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
        away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
        hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
        of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
        children of Israel.

020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
        the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
        the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
        chosen men.

020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
        lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
        and not miss.

020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
        hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
        war.

020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
        God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
        up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
        the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
        encamped against Gibeah.

020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
        the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
        them at Gibeah.

020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
        destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
        and two thousand men.

020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
        set their battle again in array in the place where they put
        themselves in array the first day.

020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
        until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
        up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
        brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
        Benjamin the second day.

020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
        day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
        Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
        the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
        of the covenant of God was there in those days,

020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
        before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
        battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
        cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
        them into thine hand.

020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
        Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
        Gibeah, as at other times.

020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
        were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
        people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
        one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
        the field, about thirty men of Israel.

020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
        before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
        Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
        themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
        Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
        of Gibeah.

020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
        all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
        evil was near them.

020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
        Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
        thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
        the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
        trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
        Gibeah.

020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
        liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
        with the edge of the sword.

020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
        the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
        smoke rise up out of the city.

020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
        began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
        persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
        us, as in the first battle.

020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
        pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
        behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
        were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
        and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
        midst of them.

020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
        them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
        the sunrising.

020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
        were men of valour.

020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
        of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
        thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
        two thousand men of them.

020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
        five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
        valour.

020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
        rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
        Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
        the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
        hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
        even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
        Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
        Israel?

021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
        peace offerings.

021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
        tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
        the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
        came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
        put to death.

021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
        brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
        day.

021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
        sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
        to wives?

021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
        came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
        none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
        the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
        valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
        inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
        the women and the children.

021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
        destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
        hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
        male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
        in the land of Canaan.

021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
        of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
        peaceably unto them.

021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
        which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
        yet so they sufficed them not.

021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
        LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
        of Benjamin?

021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
        escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
        Israel.

021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
        children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
        giveth a wife to Benjamin.

021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
        yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
        east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah.

021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
        and lie in wait in the vineyards;

021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
        dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
        you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
        the land of Benjamin.

021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
        unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
        unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
        his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
        time, that ye should be guilty.

021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
        according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
        caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
        repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
        man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
        thence every man to his inheritance.

021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
        which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08	Ruth

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
        there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
        Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
        his wife, and his two sons.

001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
        wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
        Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
        of Moab, and continued there.

001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
        two sons.

001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
        one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
        dwelled there about ten years.

001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
        was left of her two sons and her husband.

001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
        return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
        country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
        giving them bread.

001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
        her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
        return unto the land of Judah.

001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
        to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
        have dealt with the dead, and with me.

001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
        house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.

001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
        thy people.

001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
        me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
        your husbands?

001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
        have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
        have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
        for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
        grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
        gone out against me.

001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
        kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
        people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
        law.

001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
        following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
        where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
        people, and thy God my God:

001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
        LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
        and me.

001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
        then she left speaking unto her.

001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
        pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
        moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
        the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
        why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
        against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
        law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
        they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
        wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
        field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
        find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
        reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
        belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
        reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
        bless thee.

002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
        Whose damsel is this?

002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
        said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
        of the country of Moab:

002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
        reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
        even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
        the house.

002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
        not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
        abide here fast by my maidens:

002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
        after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
        not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
        vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
        thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
        me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
        death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
        thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
        people which thou knewest not heretofore.

002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
        of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
        trust.

002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
        that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
        friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
        thine handmaidens.

002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
        of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
        beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
        did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
        men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
        reproach her not:

002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
        leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
        had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
        law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
        to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
        to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
        knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
        she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
        to day is Boaz.

002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
        LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
        the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
        us, one of our next kinsmen.

002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
        keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
        harvest.

002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
        daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
        thee not in any other field.

002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
        mother in law.

003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
        I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
        wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
        threshingfloor.

003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
        upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
        thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
        and drinking.

003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
        place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
        his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
        shalt do.

003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
        that her mother in law bade her.

003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
        went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
        softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
        turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
        handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
        thou art a near kinsman.

003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
        thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
        beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
        poor or rich.

003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
        thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
        thou art a virtuous woman.

003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
        is a kinsman nearer than I.

003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
        will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
        the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
        kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
        as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
        before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
        known that a woman came into the floor.

003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
        hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
        barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
        thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
        to her.

003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
        said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
        matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
        have finished the thing this day.

004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
        behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
        said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
        aside, and sat down.

004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
        ye down here. And they sat down.

004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
        the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
        brother Elimelech's:

004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
        inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
        redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
        tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
        beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
        it.

004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
        Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
        of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
        inheritance.

004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
        I cannot redeem it.

004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
        a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
        this was a testimony in Israel.

004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
        drew off his shoe.

004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
        witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
        Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
        hand of Naomi.

004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
        his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
        among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
        witnesses this day.

004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
        said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
        into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
        build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
        and be famous in Bethlehem:

004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
        unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
        young woman.

004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
        unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
        not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
        famous in Israel.

004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
        nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
        loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
        born him.

004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse unto it.

004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
        a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
        father of Jesse, the father of David.

004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09	1 Samuel

001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
        Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
        name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
        Hannah had no children.

001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
        sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
        there.

001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
        Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
        portions:

001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
        but the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
        fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
        of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
        not eat.

001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
        thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
        am not I better to thee than ten sons?

001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
        they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
        of the temple of the LORD.

001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
        and wept sore.

001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
        indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
        me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
        handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
        the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
        head.

001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
        that Eli marked her mouth.

001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
        her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
        drunken.

001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
        thy wine from thee.

001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
        sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
        but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
        the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
        hitherto.

001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
        grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
        the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
        no more sad.

001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
        the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
        Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
        Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
        Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
        the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
        not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
        him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
        ever.

001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
        good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
        establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
        until she weaned him.

001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
        three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
        and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
        child was young.

001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
        the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
        petition which I asked of him:

001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
        liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
        LORD there.

002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
        mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
        mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
        neither is there any rock like our God.

002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
        of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
        actions are weighed.

002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
        are girded with strength.

002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
        they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
        seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
        grave, and bringeth up.

002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
        lifteth up.

002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
        beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
        make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
        earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
        silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
        heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
        ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
        and exalt the horn of his anointed.

002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
        minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
        LORD.

002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
        man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
        flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
        hand;

002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
        all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
        So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
        thither.

002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
        said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
        priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
        fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
        then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
        and if not, I will take it by force.

002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
        LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
        with a linen ephod.

002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
        him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
        offer the yearly sacrifice.

002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
        thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
        LORD. And they went unto their own home.

002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
        three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
        the LORD.

002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
        Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
        your evil dealings by all this people.

002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
        the LORD's people to transgress.

002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
        if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
        Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
        father, because the LORD would slay them.

002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
        LORD, and also with men.

002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
        father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
        priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
        ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
        all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
        I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
        above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
        offerings of Israel my people?

002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
        house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
        ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
        honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
        lightly esteemed.

002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
        arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
        in thine house.

002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
        wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
        old man in thine house for ever.

002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
        altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
        heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
        flower of their age.

002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
        two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
        both of them.

002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
        according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
        will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
        anointed for ever.

002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
        thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
        and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
        into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
        bread.

003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
        the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
        open vision.

003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
        his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
        see;

003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
        where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
        me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
        lay down.

003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
        went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
        he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
        the LORD yet revealed unto him.

003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
        And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
        if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
        servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
        Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
        heareth.

003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
        Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
        shall tingle.

003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
        spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
        end.

003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
        the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
        themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
        iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
        offering for ever.

003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
        house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
        answered, Here am I.

003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
        thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
        more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
        that he said unto thee.

003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
        he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
        of his words fall to the ground.

003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
        established to be a prophet of the LORD.

003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
        himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
        against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
        Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
        and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
        Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
        thousand men.

004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
        Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
        the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
        may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
        thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
        Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
        of God.

004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
        camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
        rang again.

004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
        said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
        of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
        was come into the camp.

004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
        into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
        been such a thing heretofore.

004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
        mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
        all the plagues in the wilderness.

004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
        ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
        quit yourselves like men, and fight.

004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
        fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
        slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
        and Phinehas, were slain.

004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
        Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
        his head.

004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
        watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
        the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
        out.

004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
        meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
        and told Eli.

004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
        that he could not see.

004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
        and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
        done, my son?

004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
        Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
        the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
        dead, and the ark of God is taken.

004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
        that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
        gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
        and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
        to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
        of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
        were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
        upon her.

004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
        said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
        answered not, neither did she regard it.

004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
        from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
        her father in law and her husband.

004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
        of God is taken.

005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
        Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
        Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
        the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
        was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
        LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
        were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
        left to him.

005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
        this day.

005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
        destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
        the coasts thereof.

005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
        ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
        is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
        Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
        of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
        God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
        ark of the God of Israel about thither.

005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
        of the LORD was against the city with a very great
        destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
        great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
        pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
        cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
        of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
        Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
        our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
        the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
        the cry of the city went up to heaven.

006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
        seven months.

006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
        saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
        wherewith we shall send it to his place.

006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
        offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
        you why his hand is not removed from you.

006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
        shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
        five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
        Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
        your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
        God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
        you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
        Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
        among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
        which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
        and bring their calves home from them:

006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
        put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
        offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
        that it may go.

006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
        Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
        then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
        was a chance that happened to us.

006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
        the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
        coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
        and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
        not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
        the Philistines went after them unto the border of
        Bethshemesh.

006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
        the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
        and rejoiced to see it.

006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
        stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
        wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
        that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
        them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
        burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
        the LORD.

006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
        returned to Ekron the same day.

006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
        returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
        one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
        one;

006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
        cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
        Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
        remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
        Bethshemite.

006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
        into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
        thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
        because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
        slaughter.

006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
        this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
        saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
        LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
        the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
        hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
        LORD.

007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
        that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
        house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
        do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
        the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
        your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
        deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
        and served the LORD only.

007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
        for you unto the LORD.

007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
        poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
        said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
        the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
        were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
        went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
        it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
        unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
        hand of the Philistines.

007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
        offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
        for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
        Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
        thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
        Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
        before Israel.

007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
        Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
        LORD helped us.

007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
        the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
        Philistines all the days of Samuel.

007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
        were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
        coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
        Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
        Amorites.

007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
        Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
        there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
        LORD.

008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
        sons judges over Israel.

008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
        second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
        lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
        and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
        in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
        nations.

008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
        king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
        people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
        rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
        reign over them.

008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
        that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
        wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
        they also unto thee.

008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
        solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
        shall reign over them.

008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
        asked of him a king.

008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
        reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
        himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
        shall run before his chariots.

008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
        over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
        his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
        instruments of his chariots.

008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
        be cooks, and to be bakers.

008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
        oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
        servants.

008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
        vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
        your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
        work.

008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
        servants.

008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
        shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
        day.

008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
        and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
        them in the ears of the LORD.

008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
        make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
        ye every man unto his city.

009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
        Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
        a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
        goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
        higher than any of the people.

009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
        arise, go seek the asses.

009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
        land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
        through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
        passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
        not.

009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
        servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
        father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
        of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
        surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
        shew us our way that we should go.

009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
        shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
        have we?

009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
        here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
        I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
        he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
        called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
        they went unto the city where the man of God was.

009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
        maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
        seer here?

009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
        you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
        is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
        him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
        will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
        sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
        therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
        the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
        to the high place.

009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
        came, saying,

009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
        land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
        my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
        of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
        their cry is come unto me.

009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
        man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
        people.

009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
        I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
        before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
        day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
        that is in thine heart.

009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
        thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
        desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
        house?

009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
        smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
        all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
        speakest thou so to me?

009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
        the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
        them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
        thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
        and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
        left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
        been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
        Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
        city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
        the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
        saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
        they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
        said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
        passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
        the word of God.

010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
        and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
        anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
        two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
        Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
        wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
        care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
        do for my son?

010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
        to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
        going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
        another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
        bottle of wine:

010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
        which thou shalt receive of their hands.

010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
        garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
        thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
        company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
        psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
        and they shall prophesy:

010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
        prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
        do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
        will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
        sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
        tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
        Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
        to pass that day.

010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
        prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
        prophesied among them.

010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
        that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
        people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
        son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
        father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
        high place.

010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
        went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
        they were no where, we came to Samuel.

010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
        unto you.

010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
        asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
        Samuel spake, he told him not.

010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
        kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
        out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
        said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
        present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
        thousands.

010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
        near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
        families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
        Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
        found.

010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
        yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
        himself among the stuff.

010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
        shoulders and upward.

010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
        hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
        And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
        wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
        sent all the people away, every man to his house.

010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
        band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
        And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
        his peace.

011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
        Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
        a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
        I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
        right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
        respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
        Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
        out to thee.

011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
        tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
        up their voices, and wept.

011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
        Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
        told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
        tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
        them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
        messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
        after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
        of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
        consent.

011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
        were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
        thousand.

011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
        unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
        be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
        it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
        unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
        you.

011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
        companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
        morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
        day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
        scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
        Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
        death.

011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
        for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
        and renew the kingdom there.

011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
        king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
        sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
        and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
        your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
        over you.

012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
        grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
        walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
        before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
        I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
        of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
        therewith? and I will restore it you.

012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
        neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
        his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
        in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
        Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
        land of Egypt.

012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
        the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
        to you and to your fathers.

012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
        the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
        forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
        place.

012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
        hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
        hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
        Moab, and they fought against them.

012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
        because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
        Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
        and we will serve thee.

012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
        Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
        every side, and ye dwelled safe.

012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
        came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
        over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
        have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
        and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
        both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
        following the LORD your God:

012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
        against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
        the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
        will do before your eyes.

012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
        he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
        that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
        of the LORD, in asking you a king.

012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
        rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
        Samuel.

012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
        unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
        all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
        this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
        but serve the LORD with all your heart;

012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
        things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
        sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
        LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
        and the right way:

012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
        heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
        ye and your king.

013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
        Israel,

013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
        thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
        rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
        Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
        trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
        the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
        with the Philistines. And the people were called together
        after Saul to Gilgal.

013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
        Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
        and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
        and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
        Bethaven.

013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
        the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
        themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
        high places, and in pits.

013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
        and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
        people followed him trembling.

013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
        Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
        people were scattered from him.

013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
        offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
        offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
        went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
        saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
        camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
        gathered themselves together at Michmash;

013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
        to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
        forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
        not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
        commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
        kingdom upon Israel for ever.

013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
        him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
        to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
        which the LORD commanded thee.

013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
        Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
        him, about six hundred men.

013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
        present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
        Philistines encamped in Michmash.

013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
        three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
        to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
        company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
        valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
        Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
        swords or spears:

013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
        sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
        his mattock.

013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
        neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
        that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
        Jonathan his son was there found.

013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
        Michmash.

014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
        said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
        go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
        side. But he told not his father.

014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
        pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
        with him were about six hundred men;

014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
        Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
        an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
        unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
        one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
        the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
        Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
        and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
        it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
        restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
        heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
        heart.

014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
        and we will discover ourselves unto them.

014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
        will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
        the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
        a sign unto us.

014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
        the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
        come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
        armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
        thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
        me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
        his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
        his armourbearer slew after him.

014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
        made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
        land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
        all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
        trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
        trembling.

014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
        behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
        down one another.

014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
        and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
        behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
        ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
        the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
        increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
        themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
        man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
        discomfiture.

014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
        that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
        country round about, even they also turned to be with the
        Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
        mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
        they also followed hard after them in the battle.

014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
        unto Bethaven.

014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
        food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
        none of the people tasted any food.

014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
        upon the ground.

014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
        dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
        feared the oath.

014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
        the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
        in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
        to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
        that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
        pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
        tasted a little of this honey.

014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
        the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
        been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
        Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
        and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
        eat them with the blood.

014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
        the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
        have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
        unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
        sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
        LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
        every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
        altar that he built unto the LORD.

014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
        and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
        man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
        thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
        But he answered him not that day.

014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
        people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
        Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
        among all the people that answered him.

014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
        Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
        unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
        perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
        escaped.

014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
        Jonathan was taken.

014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
        Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
        with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
        die.

014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
        surely die, Jonathan.

014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
        wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
        LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
        ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
        rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
        Philistines went to their own place.

014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
        his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
        children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
        Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
        turned himself, he vexed them.

014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
        delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
        and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
        firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
        Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
        the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
        was the son of Abiel.

014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
        Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
        took him unto him.

015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
        be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
        thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
        to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
        up from Egypt.

015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
        have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
        and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
        Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
        Judah.

015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
        valley.

015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
        among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
        shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
        up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
        Amalekites.

015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
        to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
        sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
        and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
        every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
        utterly.

015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
        turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
        commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
        LORD all night.

015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
        told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
        him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
        down to Gilgal.

015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
        thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
        LORD.

015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
        in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
        the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
        destroyed.

015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
        the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
        on.

015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
        wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
        LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
        until they be consumed.

015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
        didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
        LORD?

015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
        LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
        brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
        the Amalekites.

015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
        the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
        offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
        Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
        the fat of rams.

015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
        as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
        of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
        transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
        because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
        me, that I may worship the LORD.

015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
        thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
        rejected thee from being king over Israel.

015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
        skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
        Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
        thine, that is better than thou.

015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
        he is not a man, that he should repent.

015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
        before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
        again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
        LORD.

015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
        Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
        Surely the bitterness of death is past.

015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
        shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
        Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
        Gibeah of Saul.

015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
        death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
        repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
        Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
        fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
        the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
        sons.

016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
        me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
        come to sacrifice to the LORD.

016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
        thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
        unto thee.

016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
        Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
        and said, Comest thou peaceably?

016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
        sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
        sacrifice.

016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
        Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
        on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
        the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
        outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
        And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
        the LORD chosen this.

016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
        Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
        said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
        keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
        him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
        of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
        LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
        midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
        David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
        Ramah.

016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
        spirit from the LORD troubled him.

016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
        from God troubleth thee.

016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
        to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
        shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
        thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
        well.

016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
        play well, and bring him to me.

016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
        seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
        playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
        prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
        him.

016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
        David thy son, which is with the sheep.

016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
        and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
        greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
        before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
        Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
        Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
        from him.

017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
        and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
        Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
        pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
        against the Philistines.

017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
        Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
        valley between them.

017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
        Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
        cubits and a span.

017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
        with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
        thousand shekels of brass.

017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
        brass between his shoulders.

017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
        spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
        bearing a shield went before him.

017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
        unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
        not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
        for you, and let him come down to me.

017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
        be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
        then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
        give me a man, that we may fight together.

017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
        among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
        the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
        battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
        and the third Shammah.

017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
        Saul.

017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
        sheep at Bethlehem.

017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
        presented himself forty days.

017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
        an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
        to the camp of thy brethren;

017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
        thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
        pledge.

017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
        valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
        with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
        and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
        fight, and shouted for the battle.

017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
        army against army.

017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
        carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
        brethren.

017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
        champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
        armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
        words: and David heard them.

017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
        him, and were sore afraid.

017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
        the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
        riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
        house free in Israel.

017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
        shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
        taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
        uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
        the living God?

017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
        shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
        and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
        camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
        few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
        naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
        mightest see the battle.

017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
        same manner: and the people answered him again after the
        former manner.

017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
        rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
        him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
        Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
        a man of war from his youth.

017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
        and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
        flock:

017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
        of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
        his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
        uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
        hath defied the armies of the living God.

017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
        of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
        me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
        David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
        brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
        go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
        cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
        put them off him.

017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
        stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
        which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
        and he drew near to the Philistine.

017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
        man that bare the shield went before him.

017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
        disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
        fair countenance.

017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
        comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
        his gods.

017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
        thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
        field.

017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
        sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
        in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
        Israel, whom thou hast defied.

017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
        smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
        carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
        fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
        all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
        sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
        give you into our hands.

017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
        drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
        the army to meet the Philistine.

017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
        and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
        the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
        the earth.

017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
        stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
        no sword in the hand of David.

017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
        his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
        him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
        saw their champion was dead, they fled.

017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
        pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
        the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
        down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
        Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
        Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
        said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
        this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
        cannot tell.

017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
        Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
        the Philistine in his hand.

017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
        David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
        Bethlehemite.

018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
        Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
        David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
        to his father's house.

018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
        as his own soul.

018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
        and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
        to his bow, and to his girdle.

018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
        himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
        was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
        sight of Saul's servants.

018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
        the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
        all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
        with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
        Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
        said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
        they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
        but the kingdom?

018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
        God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
        house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
        there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
        even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
        presence twice.

018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
        and was departed from Saul.

018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
        people.

018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
        was with him.

018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
        he was afraid of him.

018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
        came in before them.

018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
        will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
        fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
        upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
        father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
        king?

018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
        should have been given to David, that she was given unto
        Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
        and the thing pleased him.

018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
        him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
        Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
        law in the one of the twain.

018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
        secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
        all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
        law.

018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
        And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
        son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
        spake David.

018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
        not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
        be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
        well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
        expired.

018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
        the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
        foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
        he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
        his daughter to wife.

018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
        Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
        David's enemy continually.

018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
        pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
        wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
        much set by.

019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
        that they should kill David.

019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
        told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
        morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
        where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
        what I see, that I will tell thee.

019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
        said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
        against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
        because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
        and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
        sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
        against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
        As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
        things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
        presence, as in times past.

019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
        the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
        they fled from him.

019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
        his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
        his hand.

019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
        javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
        smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
        that night.

019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
        and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
        him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
        thou shalt be slain.

019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
        fled, and escaped.

019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
        pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
        cloth.

019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
        sick.

019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
        him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
        image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
        bolster.

019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
        sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
        Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
        told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
        and dwelt in Naioth.

019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
        Ramah.

019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
        company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
        appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
        of Saul, and they also prophesied.

019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
        prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
        time, and they prophesied also.

019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
        in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
        And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
        was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
        came to Naioth in Ramah.

019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
        Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
        that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
        Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
        my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
        my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
        will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
        me? it is not so.

020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
        knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
        Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
        the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
        between me and death.

020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
        will even do it for thee.

020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
        moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
        let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
        day at even.

020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
        leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
        is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
        if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
        him.

020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
        hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
        thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
        thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
        certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
        thee, then would not I tell it thee?

020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
        father answer thee roughly?

020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
        field. And they went out both of them into the field.

020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
        have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
        day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
        send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
        father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
        thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
        thee, as he hath been with my father.

020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
        of the LORD, that I die not:

020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
        ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
        every one from the face of the earth.

020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
        Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
        him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
        thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
        quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
        when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
        Ezel.

020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
        shot at a mark.

020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
        arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
        are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
        is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
        beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
        behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
        come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
        seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
        side, and David's place was empty.

020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
        thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
        he is not clean.

020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
        the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
        Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
        meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
        to go to Bethlehem:

020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
        sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
        be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
        me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
        cometh not unto the king's table.

020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
        unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
        know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
        confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
        shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
        and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
        Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
        knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
        no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
        David, because his father had done him shame.

020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
        into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
        lad with him.

020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
        shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
        not the arrow beyond thee?

020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
        And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
        master.

020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
        the matter.

020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
        him, Go, carry them to the city.

020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
        toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
        bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
        wept one with another, until David exceeded.

020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
        sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
        between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
        ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
        city.

021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
        was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
        thou alone, and no man with thee?

021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
        commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
        know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
        what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
        to such and such a place.

021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
        bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
        bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
        young men have kept themselves at least from women.

021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
        women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
        came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
        bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
        this day in the vessel.

021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
        there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
        detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
        the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
        thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
        nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
        haste.

021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
        thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
        in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
        for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
        none like that; give it me.

021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
        to Achish the king of Gath.

021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
        the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
        in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
        his ten thousands?

021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
        afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
        mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
        and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
        wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
        play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
        my house?

022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
        Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
        heard it, they went down thither to him.

022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
        debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
        unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
        with him about four hundred men.

022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
        king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
        forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
        with him all the while that David was in the hold.

022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
        depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
        departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
        were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
        Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
        standing about him;)

022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
        now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
        you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
        thousands, and captains of hundreds;

022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
        that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
        Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
        sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
        me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
        servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
        Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
        and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
        Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
        Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
        Here I am, my lord.

022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
        and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
        sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
        faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
        son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
        thine house?

022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
        let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
        the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
        this, less or more.

022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
        all thy father's house.

022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
        and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
        with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
        shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
        forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
        priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
        priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
        did wear a linen ephod.

022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
        the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
        oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
        Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
        priests.

022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
        the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
        occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
        seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
        against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
        smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
        smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
        Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
        armies of the Philistines?

023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
        answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
        deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
        Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
        with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
        Keilah.

023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
        to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
        hand.

023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
        said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
        in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
        Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
        him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
        ephod.

023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
        certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
        destroy the city for my sake.

023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
        come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
        beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
        come down.

023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
        into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
        thee up.

023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
        and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
        go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
        and he forbare to go forth.

023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
        remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
        sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
        David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
        wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
        shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
        shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
        hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
        of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
        into the king's hand.

023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
        compassion on me.

023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
        his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
        that he dealeth very subtilly.

023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
        where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
        certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
        if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
        all the thousands of Judah.

023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
        his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
        south of Jeshimon.

023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
        wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
        wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
        David in the wilderness of Maon.

023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
        men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
        and his men round about to take them.

023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
        come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
        against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
        Selahammahlekoth.

023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
        Engedi.

024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
        Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
        the wilderness of Engedi.

024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
        and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
        goats.

024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
        and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
        remained in the sides of the cave.

024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
        the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
        into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
        good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
        Saul's robe privily.

024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
        this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
        forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
        LORD.

024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
        them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
        cave, and went on his way.

024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
        cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
        looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
        and bowed himself.

024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
        saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
        delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
        bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
        will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
        LORD's anointed.

024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
        hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
        thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
        transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
        thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
        thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
        from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
        thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
        these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
        hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
        with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
        thine hand, thou killedst me not.

024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
        wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
        unto me this day.

024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
        and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
        hand.

024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
        cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
        name out of my father's house.

024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
        his men gat them up unto the hold.

025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
        together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
        Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
        Paran.

025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
        and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
        Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
        beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
        his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
        sheep.

025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
        young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
        him in my name:

025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
        be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
        unto all that thou hast.

025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
        shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
        there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
        Carmel.

025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
        young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
        day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
        thy servants, and to thy son David.

025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
        and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
        that break away every man from his master.

025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
        have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
        not whence they be?

025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
        came and told him all those sayings.

025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
        And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
        on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
        men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
        Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
        our master; and he railed on them.

025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
        neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
        with them, when we were in the fields:

025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
        we were with them keeping the sheep.

025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
        determined against our master, and against all his household:
        for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
        him.

025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
        bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
        come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
        the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
        down against her; and she met them.

025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
        fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
        all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
        good.

025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
        of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
        pisseth against the wall.

025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
        ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
        the ground,

025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
        this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
        Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
        folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
        of my lord, whom thou didst send.

025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
        liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
        shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
        let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
        Nabal.

025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
        my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
        my lord.

025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
        LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
        fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
        in thee all thy days.

025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
        the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
        the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
        he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
        lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
        thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
        unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
        that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
        have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
        which sent thee this day to meet me:

025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
        kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
        myself with mine own hand.

025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
        kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
        come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
        the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
        and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
        hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
        house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
        within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
        nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
        of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
        heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
        Nabal, that he died.

025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
        the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
        hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
        LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
        And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
        to wife.

025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
        they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
        thee to him to wife.

025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
        said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
        of the servants of my lord.

025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
        damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
        messengers of David, and became his wife.

025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
        them his wives.

025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
        Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon?

026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
        David in the wilderness of Ziph.

026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
        he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
        come in very deed.

026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
        and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
        of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
        and the people pitched round about him.

026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
        Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
        go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
        go down with thee.

026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
        Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
        the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
        about him.

026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
        into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
        pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
        will not smite him the second time.

026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
        stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
        guiltless?

026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
        smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
        into battle, and perish.

026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
        the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
        that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
        bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
        it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
        sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
        of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
        saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
        said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
        is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
        thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
        destroy the king thy lord.

026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
        liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
        master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
        spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
        servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
        words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
        me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
        men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
        out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
        saying, Go, serve other gods.

026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
        face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
        flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
        will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
        thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
        erred exceedingly.

026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
        one of the young men come over and fetch it.

026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
        faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
        but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
        anointed.

026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
        eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
        and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
        shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
        David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
        hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
        should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
        Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
        Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
        that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
        Gath.

027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
        sought no more again for him.

027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
        eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
        that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
        the royal city with thee?

027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
        pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
        Philistines was a full year and four months.

027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
        the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
        old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
        unto the land of Egypt.

027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
        alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
        and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
        Achish.

027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
        said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
        Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
        to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
        David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
        the country of the Philistines.

027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
        Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
        for ever.

028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
        gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
        Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
        thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
        servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
        make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
        buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
        away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
        the land.

028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
        pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
        they pitched in Gilboa.

028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
        and his heart greatly trembled.

028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
        his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit at Endor.

028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
        went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
        night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
        familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
        thee.

028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
        hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
        spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
        layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
        there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
        said, Bring me up Samuel.

028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
        and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
        me? for thou art Saul.

028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
        thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
        of the earth.

028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
        man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
        perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
        the ground, and bowed himself.

028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
        me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
        Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
        and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
        therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
        me what I shall do.

028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
        the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
        hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
        neighbour, even to David:

028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
        executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
        LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
        hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
        be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
        into the hand of the Philistines.

028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
        sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
        strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
        all the night.

028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
        troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
        obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
        hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
        of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
        thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
        on thy way.

028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
        together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
        their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
        killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
        unleavened bread thereof:

028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
        they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
        Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
        Jezreel.

029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
        thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
        with Achish.

029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
        Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
        Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
        of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
        and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
        this day?

029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
        the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
        return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
        appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
        in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
        he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
        the heads of these men?

029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
        saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
        LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
        coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
        not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
        unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
        the lords of the Philistines.

029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
        hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
        thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
        enemies of my lord the king?

029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
        good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
        princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
        us to the battle.

029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
        servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
        early in the morning, and have light, depart.

029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
        to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
        Philistines went up to Jezreel.

030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
        Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
        south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
        fire;

030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
        not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
        went on their way.

030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
        burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
        daughters, were taken captives.

030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
        stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
        every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
        encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
        thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
        the ephod to David.

030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
        this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
        Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
        recover all.

030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
        and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
        stayed.

030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
        abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
        the brook Besor.

030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
        David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
        drink water;

030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
        of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
        him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
        days and three nights.

030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
        art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
        an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
        I fell sick.

030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
        upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
        Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
        company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
        neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
        and I will bring thee down to this company.

030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
        abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
        land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
        of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
        four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
        and David rescued his two wives.

030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
        great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
        thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
        before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
        that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
        abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
        and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
        near to the people, he saluted them.

030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
        that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
        we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
        recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
        they may lead them away, and depart.

030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
        which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
        delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
        is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
        tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
        and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
        elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
        for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
        Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
        Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
        the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
        cities of the Kenites,

030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
        Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
        David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
        and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Melchishua, Saul's sons.

031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
        thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
        thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
        not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
        fell upon it.

031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
        all his men, that same day together.

031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
        valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
        the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
        fallen in mount Gilboa.

031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
        sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
        it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
        fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
        the Philistines had done to Saul;

031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
        body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
        Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
        Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10	2 Samuel

001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
        returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
        abode two days in Ziklag;

001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
        came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
        earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
        that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
        unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
        tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
        battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
        Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
        thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
        upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
        lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
        And I answered, Here am I.

001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
        Amalekite.

001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
        me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
        in me.

001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
        could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
        that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
        and have brought them hither unto my lord.

001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
        likewise all the men that were with him:

001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
        for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
        sword.

001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
        thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
        Amalekite.

001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
        forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
        fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
        mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
        LORD's anointed.

001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son:

001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
        bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
        the mighty fallen!

001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
        lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
        daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
        be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
        shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
        as though he had not been anointed with oil.

001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
        bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
        returned not empty.

001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
        in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
        eagles, they were stronger than lions.

001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
        upon your apparel.

001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
        Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
        hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
        the love of women.

001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
        LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
        And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
        shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
        men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
        said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
        this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
        him.

002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
        will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
        thing.

002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
        valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
        Judah have anointed me king over them.

002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
        over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
        all Israel.

002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
        reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
        Judah followed David.

002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
        Judah was seven years and six months.

002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
        son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
        out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
        down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
        the other side of the pool.

002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
        before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
        which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
        the servants of David.

002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
        Gibeon.

002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
        beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
        and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
        the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
        he answered, I am.

002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
        thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
        thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
        following of him.

002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
        me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
        should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
        hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
        the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
        died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
        came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
        hill.

002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
        for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
        latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
        return from following their brethren?

002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
        then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
        following his brother.

002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
        pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
        and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
        came to Mahanaim.

002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
        gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
        servants nineteen men and Asahel.

002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
        Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
        his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
        all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
        of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
        Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
        Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
        daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;

003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
        to David in Hebron.

003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
        Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        for the house of Saul.

003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
        gone in unto my father's concubine?

003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
        said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
        this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
        of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
        this woman?

003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
        sworn to David, even so I do to him;

003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
        the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
        to Beersheba.

003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
        him.

003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
        Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
        behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
        unto thee.

003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
        thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
        except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
        comest to see my face.

003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
        hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Phaltiel the son of Laish.

003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
        Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
        returned.

003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
        the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
        of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
        their enemies.

003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
        Benjamin.

003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
        David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
        gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
        league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
        thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
        in peace.

003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
        a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
        not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.

003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
        told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
        he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
        behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
        him away, and he is quite gone?

003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
        thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
        all that thou doest.

003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
        but David knew it not.

003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
        the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
        the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
        brother.

003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:

003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
        house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
        hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
        or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
        slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
        him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
        voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
        wept.

003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
        fool dieth?

003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
        man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
        people wept again over him.

003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
        it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
        also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
        whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
        a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
        the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
        hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
        name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
        (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
        until this day.)

004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
        Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
        went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
        Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
        they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
        fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
        bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
        him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
        all night.

004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
        Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
        avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
        Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
        who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
        have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
        Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
        his tidings:

004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
        require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
        earth?

004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
        pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
        buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
        spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
        that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
        to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
        captain over Israel.

005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
        king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.

005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years.

005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
        Israel and Judah.

005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
        Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
        come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
        the city of David.

005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
        gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
        that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
        Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
        into the house.

005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
        And David built round about from Millo and inward.

005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
        was with him.

005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
        trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
        house.

005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
        over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
        people Israel's sake.

005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
        daughters born to David.

005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
        Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
        king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
        LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
        Philistines into thine hand.

005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
        said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
        as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
        place Baalperazim.

005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
        them.

005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.

005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
        go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
        thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
        the host of the Philistines.

005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
        Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.

006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
        him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
        God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
        that dwelleth between the cherubims.

006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
        Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
        Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
        ark.

006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
        on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
        and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
        cymbals.

006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
        his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
        shook it.

006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
        smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
        God.

006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
        this day.

006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
        the ark of the LORD come to me?

006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
        the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obededom the Gittite.

006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
        Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
        his household.

006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
        house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
        of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
        from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
        gladness.

006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
        had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
        was girded with a linen ephod.

006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
        LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
        Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
        leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
        her heart.

006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
        place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
        for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
        before the LORD.

006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
        offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
        name of the LORD of hosts.

006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
        multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
        a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
        wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
        daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
        glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
        to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
        the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
        chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
        appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before the LORD.

006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
        mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
        of, of them shall I be had in honour.

006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
        day of her death.

007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
        LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
        curtains.

007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
        heart; for the LORD is with thee.

007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
        unto Nathan, saying,

007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
        build me an house for me to dwell in?

007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
        brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
        day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
        of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
        ye not me an house of cedar?

007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
        following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
        off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
        great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
        the earth.

007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
        move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
        them any more, as beforetime,

007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
        enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
        house.

007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
        fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
        proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
        throne of his kingdom for ever.

007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
        iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
        stripes of the children of men:

007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
        Saul, whom I put away before thee.

007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
        before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
        Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
        thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
        to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
        knowest thy servant.

007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
        thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
        them.

007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
        thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
        that we have heard with our ears.

007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
        Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
        to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
        terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
        redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
        gods?

007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
        people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
        God.

007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
        thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
        and do as thou hast said.

007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
        hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
        David be established before thee.

007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
        servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
        thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
        and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
        O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
        house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
        down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
        death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
        Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
        horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
        the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
        chariots.

008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
        king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
        thousand men.

008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
        became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
        David took exceeding much brass.

008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
        host of Hadadezer,

008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
        smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
        brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
        vessels of brass:

008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
        silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
        subdued;

008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
        Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
        garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
        the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
        and justice unto all his people.

008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;

008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
        Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
        Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
        unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
        that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
        unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
        feet.

009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
        the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
        Ammiel, in Lodebar.

009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
        Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
        And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
        servant!

009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
        kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
        all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
        my table continually.

009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
        shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
        him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
        Saul and to all his house.

009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
        land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
        master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
        master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
        fifteen sons and twenty servants.

009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
        the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.

009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
        all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
        Mephibosheth.

009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
        at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
        of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
        to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
        lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
        hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
        servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
        to overthrow it?

010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
        half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
        middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
        the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
        Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
        David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
        Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
        and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
        thousand men.

010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
        and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
        the field.

010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:

010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
        Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
        the children of Ammon.

010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will come and help thee.

010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
        and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
        seemeth him good.

010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
        the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
        Jerusalem.

010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.

010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
        beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
        captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
        themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
        seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
        horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
        died there.

010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
        that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
        Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
        children of Ammon any more.

011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
        when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
        servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
        children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
        still at Jerusalem.

011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
        off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
        from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
        was very beautiful to look upon.

011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
        not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite?

011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
        him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
        uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
        am with child.

011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
        Joab sent Uriah to David.

011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
        Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
        feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
        followed him a mess of meat from the king.

011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
        servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
        his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
        journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
        house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
        livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
        I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the morrow.

011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
        him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
        his house.

011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
        to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
        forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
        he may be smitten, and die.

011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
        assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
        were.

011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
        there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
        Uriah the Hittite died also.

011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
        war;

011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
        of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
        thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
        did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
        cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
        died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
        servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
        had sent him for.

011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
        against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
        upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
        some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
        Hittite is dead also.

011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
        Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
        devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
        against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
        dead, she mourned for her husband.

011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
        his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
        the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
        said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.

012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
        he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
        him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
        drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
        as a daughter.

012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
        take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
        wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
        lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
        said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
        this thing shall surely die:

012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
        thing, and because he had no pity.

012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
        LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
        delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
        into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
        Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
        given unto thee such and such things.

012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
        do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
        the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
        slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
        because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
        Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
        out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
        eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
        thy wives in the sight of this sun.

012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
        all Israel, and before the sun.

012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
        And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
        sin; thou shalt not die.

012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
        to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
        is born unto thee shall surely die.

012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
        child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
        him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
        bread with them.

012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
        And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
        was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
        alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
        voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead?

012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
        perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
        his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
        himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
        the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
        when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
        hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
        was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
        eat bread.

012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?

012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
        back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
        and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
        Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
        his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
        took the royal city.

012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
        encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.

012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
        Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
        whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
        was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
        city in great abundance.

012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
        them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
        iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
        he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
        all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
        had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
        David loved her.

013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
        Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
        to do anything to her.

013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
        Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
        from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
        him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
        thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
        him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
        and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
        at her hand.

013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
        let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
        sight, that I may eat at her hand.

013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
        down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
        his sight, and did bake the cakes.

013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
        refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
        they went out every man from him.

013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
        that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
        she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
        brother.

013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
        her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
        such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
        thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
        pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
        from thee.

013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
        stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
        he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
        her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
        me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
        he would not hearken unto her.

013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
        such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
        apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
        door after her.

013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
        divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
        and went on crying.

013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
        been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
        brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
        her brother Absalom's house.

013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
        wroth.

013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
        for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
        Tamar.

013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
        Absalom invited all the king's sons.

013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
        servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
        his servants go with thy servant.

013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
        go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
        howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
        go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
        thee?

013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.

013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
        you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
        commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
        him up upon his mule, and fled.

013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
        came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.

013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
        earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
        said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
        young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
        appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
        that he forced his sister Tamar.

013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
        heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
        only is dead.

013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
        up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
        by the way of the hill side behind him.

013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
        as thy servant said, so it is.

013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
        speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
        their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
        wept very sore.

013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
        of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
        years.

013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.

014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
        said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
        put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
        but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
        Joab put the words in her mouth.

014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
        her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
        king.

014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
        the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
        the other, and slew him.

014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
        and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
        kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
        will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
        which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
        nor remainder upon the earth.

014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
        will give charge concerning thee.

014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.

014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
        me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
        God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
        destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
        the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
        the earth.

014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
        thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
        thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
        home again his banished.

014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
        which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
        any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
        expelled from him.

014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
        be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
        hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.

014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
        now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
        king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
        be with thee.

014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
        me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
        woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
        this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
        lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
        from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
        Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
        thine handmaid:

014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
        this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
        angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
        thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
        and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
        knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
        in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
        Jerusalem.

014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
        not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
        not the king's face.

014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
        Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
        crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
        that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
        therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
        two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
        king's face.

014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
        but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
        second time, he would not come.

014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
        mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
        unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
        Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
        Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
        have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
        face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
        face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
        Absalom.

015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
        chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
        gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
        came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
        and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.

015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
        right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
        me, and I would do him justice!

015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
        obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
        him.

015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
        king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
        Israel.

015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
        the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve the LORD.

015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
        to Hebron.

015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
        shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
        were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
        not any thing.

015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
        counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
        sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.

015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
        men of Israel are after Absalom.

015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
        Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
        escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
        suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
        edge of the sword.

015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
        servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
        appoint.

015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
        the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
        house.

015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
        tarried in a place that was far off.

015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
        Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
        hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
        the king.

015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
        also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
        for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
        go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
        thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
        thee.

015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
        as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
        king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
        thy servant be.

015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
        Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
        that were with him.

015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
        Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
        wilderness.

015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
        the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
        God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
        passing out of the city.

015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
        the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
        will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
        I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
        return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
        come word from you to certify me.

015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
        Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
        he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
        and all the people that was with him covered every man his
        head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
        conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
        thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
        the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
        came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
        shalt be a burden unto me:

015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
        be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
        hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
        for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
        priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
        shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
        Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
        Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
        send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
        into Jerusalem.

016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
        asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
        an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
        fruits, and a bottle of wine.

016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
        Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
        the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
        said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
        said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.

016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
        pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
        thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
        man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
        the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
        David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
        right hand and on his left.

016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
        bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
        Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
        delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
        behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
        bloody man.

016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
        this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
        thee, and take off his head.

016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
        him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
        so?

016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
        son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
        more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
        curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
        the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
        the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
        threw stones at him, and cast dust.

016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
        weary, and refreshed themselves there.

016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
        Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
        was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
        the king, God save the king.

016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
        friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
        people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
        with him will I abide.

016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
        presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
        presence, so will I be in thy presence.

016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
        we shall do.

016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
        concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
        Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
        shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
        Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
        all Israel.

016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
        days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
        was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
        Absalom.

017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
        twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
        this night:

017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
        and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
        shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
        thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
        in peace.

017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
        Israel.

017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he saith.

017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
        saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
        after his saying? if not; speak thou.

017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
        given is not good at this time.

017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
        they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
        bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
        man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
        it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
        first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
        slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
        lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
        father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
        men.

017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
        thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
        sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
        person.

017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
        found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
        ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
        shall not be left so much as one.

017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there be not one small stone found there.

017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
        Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
        Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
        Absalom.

017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
        and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
        Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
        this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
        over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
        are with him.

017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
        be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
        and they went and told king David.

017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
        both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
        Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
        down.

017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
        mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
        known.

017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
        they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
        unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
        had sought and could not find them, they returned to
        Jerusalem.

017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
        up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
        unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
        hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
        they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
        one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
        saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
        his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
        and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.

017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
        which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
        Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
        Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
        Gileadite of Rogelim,

017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
        barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
        and parched pulse,

017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
        David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
        said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
        wilderness.

018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
        Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
        Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.

018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
        flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
        die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
        thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
        us out of the city.

018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
        And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
        out by hundreds and by thousands.

018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
        Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.

018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
        battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
        David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
        twenty thousand men.

018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
        country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
        sword devoured.

018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
        mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
        and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
        between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
        him went away.

018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
        saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
        sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
        ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
        a girdle.

018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
        hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
        charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.

018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
        life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
        thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
        three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
        Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
        smote Absalom, and slew him.

018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
        pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
        wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
        Israel fled every one to his tent.

018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
        himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
        have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
        pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
        Absalom's place.

018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
        enemies.

018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
        but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
        shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
        And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
        howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
        said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
        no tidings ready?

018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
        to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
        eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
        If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
        apace, and drew near.

018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
        called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
        alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
        is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
        said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
        he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
        said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
        men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
        answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
        servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
        turned aside, and stood still.

018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
        king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
        rose up against thee.

018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
        And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
        that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
        is.

018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
        the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
        Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
        thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
        for Absalom.

019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
        people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
        grieved for his son.

019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
        people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
        voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
        shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
        have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
        daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
        concubines;

019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
        thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
        princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
        had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
        thee well.

019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
        servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
        will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
        worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
        youth until now.

019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
        all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
        And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.

019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
        enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
        Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
        therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
        saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
        last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
        all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
        then are ye the last to bring back the king?

019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
        host before me continually in the room of Joab.

019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
        heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
        Return thou, and all thy servants.

019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
        Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
        Jordan.

019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
        hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
        king.

019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
        household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
        of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
        me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
        perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
        Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
        behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
        Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
        Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
        anointed?

019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
        there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
        know that I am this day king over Israel?

019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
        the king sware unto him.

019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
        and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
        washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
        day he came again in peace.

019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
        king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
        with me, Mephibosheth?

019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
        thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
        thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
        my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
        good in thine eyes.

019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
        the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
        eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
        any more unto the king?

019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
        matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
        forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
        own house.

019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
        over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
        and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
        Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
        I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
        that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
        good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
        drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
        singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
        burden unto my lord the king?

019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
        in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
        of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
        with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
        thee.

019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
        will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
        whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
        come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
        returned unto his own place.

019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
        and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
        the people of Israel.

019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
        unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
        thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
        all David's men with him, over Jordan?

019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
        the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
        this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
        he given us any gift?

019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
        have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
        David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
        should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
        words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
        men of Israel.

020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
        Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
        and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
        inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
        Israel.

020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
        Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
        king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
        the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
        house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
        unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
        living in widowhood.

020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
        within three days, and be thou here present.

020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
        do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
        servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
        and escape us.

020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
        of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
        went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
        girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
        upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
        fell out.

020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
        bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
        So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
        Bichri.

020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
        favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
        Joab.

020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
        when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
        Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
        him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
        after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
        Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
        together, and went also after him.

020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
        they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
        trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
        wall, to throw it down.

020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
        pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
        thee.

020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
        Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
        the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
        saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
        ended the matter.

020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
        wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
        I should swallow up or destroy.

020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
        son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
        king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
        from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
        shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
        they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
        out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
        city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
        unto the king.

020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
        Ahilud was recorder:

020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
        after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
        answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
        slew the Gibeonites.

021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
        the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
        remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
        unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
        children of Israel and Judah.)

021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
        you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
        bless the inheritance of the LORD?

021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
        gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
        any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
        do for you.

021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
        devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the coasts of Israel,

021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
        hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
        did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
        Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
        they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
        all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
        harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
        harvest.

021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
        water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
        the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
        the field by night.

021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
        concubine of Saul, had done.

021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
        Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
        stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
        had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
        Gilboa:

021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
        were hanged.

021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
        country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
        father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
        after that God was intreated for the land.

021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
        David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
        the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
        weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
        slain David.

021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
        Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
        him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
        thou quench not the light of Israel.

021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
        with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
        where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
        brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
        like a weaver's beam.

021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
        six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
        the giant.

021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
        brother of David slew him.

021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
        day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
        enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
        deliverer;

022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
        the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
        saviour; thou savest me from violence.

022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
        I be saved from mine enemies.

022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid;

022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
        prevented me;

022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
        and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
        enter into his ears.

022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
        moved and shook, because he was wroth.

022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
        under his feet.

022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
        the wings of the wind.

022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.

022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
        voice.

022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
        discomfited them.

022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
        world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
        blast of the breath of his nostrils.

022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
        me: for they were too strong for me.

022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.

022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
        righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
        the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
        upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
        darkness.

022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
        God?

022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
        high places.

022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        gentleness hath made me great.

022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
        slip.

022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
        not again until I had consumed them.

022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
        not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
        rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
        but he answered them not.

022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
        stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
        abroad.

022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
        thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
        knew not shall serve me.

022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
        hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
        their close places.

022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
        God of the rock of my salvation.

022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
        under me.

022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
        lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
        hast delivered me from the violent man.

022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
        to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
        said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
        the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
        tongue.

023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
        that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
        riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
        springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
        an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
        this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
        it not to grow.

023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
        away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
        the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
        fire in the same place.

023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
        Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
        same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
        hundred, whom he slew at one time.

023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
        the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
        Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
        the men of Israel were gone away:

023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
        great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to spoil.

023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
        the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
        a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
        the Philistines.

023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
        slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
        the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
        the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
        Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
        was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
        unto the LORD.

023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
        is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
        their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
        these three mighty men.

023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
        chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
        hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
        captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
        in time of snow:

023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
        spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
        plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
        with his own spear.

023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among three mighty men.

023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
        the first three. And David set him over his guard.

023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
        son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
        Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
        Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
        and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
        Judah.

024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
        with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
        even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
        the number of the people.

024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
        people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
        eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
        king delight in this thing?

024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
        against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
        the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
        people of Israel.

024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
        right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
        Gad, and toward Jazer:

024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
        they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
        the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
        south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
        Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
        king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.

024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
        people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
        that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
        the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
        came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
        things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
        seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
        flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
        thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
        advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
        me.

024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
        let me not fall into the hand of man.

024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
        even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
        Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
        destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
        angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
        hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
        Araunah the Jebusite.

024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
        the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
        wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
        house.

024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
        an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
        Jebusite.

024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
        commanded.

024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
        the king on his face upon the ground.

024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
        servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
        build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
        from the people.

024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
        offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
        burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
        instruments of the oxen for wood.

024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
        And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
        of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
        the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
        bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
        silver.

024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
        for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11	1 Kings

001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
        king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
        that my lord the king may get heat.

001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
        Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
        king.

001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
        ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
        will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
        fifty men to run before him.

001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
        his mother bare him after Absalom.

001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
        Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
        Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
        which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
        the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
        Solomon his brother, he called not.

001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
        saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
        doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
        that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
        Solomon.

001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
        not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
        will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
        king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
        the king.

001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
        king said, What wouldest thou?

001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
        God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
        thou knowest it not:

001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
        and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
        priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
        servant hath he not called.

001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
        thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
        throne of my lord the king after him.

001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
        counted offenders.

001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet also came in.

001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
        when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.

001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
        cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
        sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
        and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
        king Adonijah.

001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
        called.

001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
        shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him?

001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
        came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
        redeemed my soul out of all distress,

001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
        this day.

001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
        reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
        for ever.

001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
        prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
        the king.

001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
        your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
        mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
        God save king Solomon.

001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
        my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
        appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
        Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
        with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
        my lord king David.

001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
        son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
        down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
        brought him to Gihon.

001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
        tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
        and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
        with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
        rent with the sound of them.

001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
        they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
        being in an uproar?

001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
        art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
        king David hath made Solomon king.

001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
        Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
        ride upon the king's mule:

001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
        that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
        heard.

001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
        David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
        name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
        king bowed himself upon the bed.

001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
        Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
        mine eyes even seeing it.

001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
        rose up, and went every man his way.

001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
        Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
        altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
        will not slay his servant with the sword.

001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
        shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
        shall be found in him, he shall die.

001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
        altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
        Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
        charged Solomon his son, saying,

002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
        shew thyself a man;

002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
        and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
        whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
        me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
        soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
        of Israel.

002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
        me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
        Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
        Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
        put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.

002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
        head go down to the grave in peace.

002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
        came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
        Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
        the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
        at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
        put thee to death with the sword.

002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
        and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
        head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
        David.

002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
        kingdom was established greatly.

002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
        of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
        Peaceably.

002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
        said, Say on.

002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
        all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
        the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
        it was his from the LORD.

002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
        unto him, Say on.

002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
        he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
        Shunammite to wife.

002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
        for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
        himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
        seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
        hand.

002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
        thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
        mother: for I will not say thee nay.

002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        thy brother to wife.

002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
        dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
        the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
        and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
        his own life.

002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
        me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
        this day.

002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
        Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
        Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
        barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
        because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
        afflicted.

002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
        LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
        spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
        altar.

002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
        Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
        upon him.

002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
        him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
        will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
        saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
        him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
        blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
        father.

002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
        fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
        them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
        wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
        Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
        upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
        his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
        be peace for ever from the LORD.

002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
        slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
        wilderness.

002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
        the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
        Abiathar.

002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
        forth thence any whither.

002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
        over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
        shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
        the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
        in Jerusalem many days.

002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
        servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
        Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
        Gath.

002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
        Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.

002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
        Gath, and was come again.

002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
        thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
        and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
        and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
        commandment that I have charged thee with?

002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
        wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
        David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
        wickedness upon thine own head;

002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before the LORD for ever.

002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
        out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
        established in the hand of Solomon.

003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
        house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
        no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
        his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
        places.

003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer upon that altar.

003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
        and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
        father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
        truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
        thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
        thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
        day.

003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
        instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
        know not how to go out or come in.

003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
        chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
        for multitude.

003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
        people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
        able to judge this thy so great a people?

003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
        thing.

003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
        hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
        riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
        but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
        thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
        like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
        unto thee.

003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
        both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like unto thee all thy days.

003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
        commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
        lengthen thy days.

003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
        Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
        offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
        and stood before him.

003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
        one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
        house.

003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
        that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
        there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
        house.

003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
        it.

003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
        her dead child in my bosom.

003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
        it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
        behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
        the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
        son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
        king.

003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
        and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
        is the dead, and my son is the living.

003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
        before the king.

003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
        half to the one, and half to the other.

003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
        for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
        other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
        and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
        judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
        of God was in him, to do judgment.

004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
        Zadok the priest,

004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
        and Abiathar were the priests:

004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
        friend:

004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
        Abda was over the tribute.

004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
        provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
        month in a year made provision.

004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
        and Elonbethhanan:

004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
        the land of Hepher:

004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
        Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
        and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
        Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
        Jokneam:

004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
        pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
        great cities with walls and brasen bars:

004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
        Solomon to wife:

004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
        country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
        Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
        multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
        land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
        brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
        fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
        hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
        fatted fowl.

004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
        river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
        side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
        days of Solomon.

004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
        chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
        all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
        month: they lacked nothing.

004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
        they unto the place where the officers were, every man
        according to his charge.

004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
        shore.

004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
        Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
        was in all nations round about.

004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
        thousand and five.

004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
        even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
        also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
        fishes.

004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
        had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
        father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
        unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
        about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
        soles of his feet.

005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
        that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
        LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
        Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
        build an house unto my name.

005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
        Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
        thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
        thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
        us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
        day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
        people.

005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
        things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
        desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
        fir.

005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
        and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
        thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
        there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
        my desire, in giving food for my household.

005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
        all his desire.

005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
        gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
        there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
        league together.

005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.

005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
        Adoniram was over the levy.

005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
        and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
        work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
        people that wrought in the work.

005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
        stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
        the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
        the house.

006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
        after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
        Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
        the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
        build the house of the LORD.

006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
        length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
        twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
        was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
        and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
        about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
        temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
        for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
        round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
        walls of the house.

006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
        made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
        neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
        house, while it was in building.

006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
        house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
        chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
        with beams and boards of cedar.

006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
        high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
        walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
        thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
        forsake my people Israel.

006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
        cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
        ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
        covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
        floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
        for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
        place.

006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
        long.

006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
        open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
        the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
        thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
        altar which was of cedar.

006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
        made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
        he overlaid it with gold.

006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
        finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
        oracle he overlaid with gold.

006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
        each ten cubits high.

006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
        cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
        of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
        cubits.

006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
        of one measure and one size.

006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
        the other cherub.

006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
        stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.

006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
        carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
        within and without.

006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
        without.

006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
        tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
        carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
        overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
        and upon the palm trees.

006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
        tree, a fourth part of the wall.

006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
        door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
        folding.

006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
        flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
        work.

006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
        and a row of cedar beams.

006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
        laid, in the month Zif:

006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
        eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
        thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
        seven years in building it.

007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
        finished all his house.

007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
        thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
        cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows
        of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay
        on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against
        light in three ranks.

007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
        light was against light in three ranks.

007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
        cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch
        was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were
        before them.

007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even
        the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one
        side of the floor to the other.

007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the
        porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house
        for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto
        this porch.

007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
        hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
        the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward
        the great court.

007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed
        stones, and cedars.

007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
        stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of
        the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with
        wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in
        brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high
        apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them
        about.

007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the
        tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five
        cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
        chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for
        the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
        network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
        pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were
        of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
        above, over against the belly which was by the network: and
        the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the
        other chapiter.

007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he
        set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
        Boaz.

007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work
        of the pillars finished.

007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
        other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
        and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops
        compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
        the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
        wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it
        contained two thousand baths.

007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of
        one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
        cubits the height of it.

007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had
        borders, and the borders were between the ledges:

007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
        oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base
        above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions
        made of thin work.

007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
        and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
        were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
        but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a
        cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings
        with their borders, foursquare, not round.

007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of
        the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.

007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot
        wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
        and their spokes, were all molten.

007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one
        base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
        cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and
        the borders thereof were of the same.

007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
        thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according
        to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
        casting, one measure, and one size.

007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
        baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of
        the ten bases one laver.

007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five
        on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right
        side of the house eastward over against the south.

007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
        Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king
        Solomon for the house of the LORD:

007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were
        on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
        the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
        pillars;

007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
        rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls
        of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;

007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
        vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the
        LORD, were of bright brass.

007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
        exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
        of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,
        whereupon the shewbread was,

007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and
        five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
        lamps, and the tongs of gold,

007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
        spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
        both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,
        and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.

007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house
        of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his
        father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
        LORD.

008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring
        up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of
        David, which is Zion.

008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
        Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the
        seventh month.

008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
        ark.

008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
        up.

008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
        were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,
        sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor
        numbered for multitude.

008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims.

008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
        seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were
        not seen without: and there they are unto this day.

008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
        Egypt.

008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
        cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the
        LORD.

008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
        thick darkness.

008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
        for thee to abide in for ever.

008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
        congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
        stood;)

008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
        with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,

008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
        Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.

008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
        thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well
        that it was in thine heart.

008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
        shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
        unto my name.

008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
        risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
        of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for
        the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
        covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he
        brought them out of the land of Egypt.

008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
        of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
        toward heaven:

008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
        heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
        mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
        heart:

008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
        promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
        fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
        my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
        that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk
        before me as thou hast walked before me.

008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
        verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
        house that I have builded?

008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
        be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
        servant shall make toward this place.

008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
        thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
        hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
        forgive.

008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
        upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine
        altar in this house:

008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
        justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
        righteousness.

008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
        thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication
        unto thee in this house:

008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
        Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
        unto their fathers.

008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
        confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
        afflictest them:

008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
        and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way
        wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
        thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their
        enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
        plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by
        all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
        of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
        house:

008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
        do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
        thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
        all the children of men;)

008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
        land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people
        Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
        hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
        pray toward this house;

008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
        all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of
        the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
        Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have
        builded, is called by thy name.

008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
        whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the
        LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
        house that I have built for thy name:

008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.

008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the
        enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
        the enemy, far or near;

008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
        were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto
        thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
        wickedness;

008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
        their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
        captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou
        gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,
        and the house which I have built for thy name:

008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
        thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all
        their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
        thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
        captive, that they may have compassion on them:

008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
        of iron:

008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
        servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
        hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.

008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
        earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of
        Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
        Egypt, O LORD God.

008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying
        all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from
        before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with
        his hands spread up to heaven.

008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
        a loud voice, saying,

008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
        Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
        failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        the hand of Moses his servant.

008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
        him not leave us, nor forsake us:

008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
        ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
        judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
        before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of
        his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is
        God, and that there is none else.

008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
        walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
        day.

008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
        before the LORD.

008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
        offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
        hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
        children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
        was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
        offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD
        was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
        him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
        the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and
        seven days, even fourteen days.

008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
        the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his
        servant, and for Israel his people.

009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of
        the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's
        desire which he was pleased to do,

009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared unto him at Gibeon.

009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
        supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
        this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for
        ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to
        all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and
        my judgments:

009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
        for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There
        shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
        children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
        which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
        worship them:

009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
        them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will
        I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a
        byword among all people:

009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
        hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their
        God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,
        and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all
        this evil.

009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
        had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the
        king's house,

009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
        desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in
        the land of Galilee.

009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon
        had given him; and they pleased him not.

009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
        my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this
        day.

009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
        for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and
        Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
        Gezer.

009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
        burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the
        city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
        wife.

009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for
        his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
        Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in
        all the land of his dominion.

009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
        Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the
        children of Israel,

009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
        children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon
        those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
        they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and
        his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
        work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people
        that wrought in the work.

009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto
        her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build
        Millo.

009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the
        LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the
        LORD. So he finished the house.

009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
        Edom.

009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
        knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
        hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
        concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with
        hard questions.

010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and
        when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
        that was in her heart.

010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any
        thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
        the house that he had built,

010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and
        his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the
        house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
        mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
        had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
        and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
        continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
        thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel
        for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and
        justice.

010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there
        came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
        of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
        brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and
        precious stones.

010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
        the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
        for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen
        unto this day.

010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,
        she and her servants.

010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
        the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
        the governors of the country.

010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound
        of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.

010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the best gold.

010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
        behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of
        the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
        the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
        gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.

010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
        Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
        and for wisdom.

010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
        God had put in his heart.

010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,
        and mules, a rate year by year.

010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
        had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and
        with the king at Jerusalem.

010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
        cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the
        vale, for abundance.

010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and
        so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
        Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
        daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
        Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:

011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the
        children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
        they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your
        heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
        concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
        turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
        perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his
        father.

011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
        fully after the LORD, as did David his father.

011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
        abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and
        for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
        incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
        turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto
        him twice,

011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
        not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD
        commanded.

011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
        done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my
        statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the
        kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
        father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give
        one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
        Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
        Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
        captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he
        had smitten every male in Edom;

011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
        he had cut off every male in Edom:)

011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
        servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little
        child.

011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
        men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
        Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed
        him victuals, and gave him land.

011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
        Tahpenes the queen.

011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
        Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in
        Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.

011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
        fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
        said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
        country.

011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
        that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
        answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
        Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
        when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and
        dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.

011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
        Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow
        woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.

011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
        king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the
        city of David his father.

011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
        seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
        ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
        Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
        the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field:

011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
        in twelve pieces:

011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
        the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
        out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and
        for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
        the tribes of Israel:)

011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
        Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and
        have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
        eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
        his father.

011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
        I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
        servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments
        and my statutes:

011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it unto thee, even ten tribes.

011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
        may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which
        I have chosen me to put my name there.

011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
        that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
        thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my
        sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
        servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
        house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
        ever.

011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
        Egypt until the death of Solomon.

011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
        his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
        Solomon?

011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.

011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
        Shechem to make him king.

012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
        congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
        grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
        put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
        again to me. And the people departed.

012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do
        ye advise that I may answer this people?

012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
        unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
        them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
        servants for ever.

012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
        given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
        with him, and which stood before him:

012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
        this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        which thy father did put upon us lighter?

012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
        saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
        finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
        will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with
        whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
        day.

012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
        men's counsel that they gave him;

012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
        my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.

012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
        cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,
        which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the
        son of Nebat.

012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
        David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
        your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
        Israel departed unto their tents.

012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
        all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
        king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
        to Jerusalem.

012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
        come again, that they sent and called him unto the
        congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was
        none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah
        only.

012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
        house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and
        fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
        against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
        Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
        unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant
        of the people, saying,

012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
        house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to
        the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the
        word of the LORD.

012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
        therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
        to the house of David:

012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
        at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
        unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
        shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
        and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
        Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
        out of the land of Egypt.

012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
        before the one, even unto Dan.

012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
        lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
        fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in
        Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,
        sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
        Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
        fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he
        had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
        children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
        incense.

013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
        burn incense.

013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
        said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child
        shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and
        upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that
        burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon
        thee.

013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,
        and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
        the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
        that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on
        him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not pull it in again to him.

013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
        altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of the LORD.

013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
        now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my
        hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the
        LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became
        as it was before.

013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
        refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
        half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I
        eat bread nor drink water in this place:

013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat
        no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
        thou camest.

013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
        came to Bethel.

013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
        and told him all the works that the man of God had done that
        day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,
        them they told also to their father.

013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
        sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
        Judah.

013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
        him the ass: and he rode thereon,

013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
        oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest
        from Judah? And he said, I am.

013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
        place:

013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
        no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
        way that thou camest.

013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an
        angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
        back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and
        drink water. But he lied unto him.

013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
        drank water.

013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
        of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
        mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the
        LORD thy God commanded thee,

013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
        place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,
        and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
        sepulchre of thy fathers.

013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
        had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
        prophet whom he had brought back.

013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
        and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,
        the lion also stood by the carcase.

013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
        way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and
        told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
        thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
        unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered
        him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.

013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
        saddled him.

013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
        and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
        the carcase, nor torn the ass.

013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
        laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
        came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.

013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
        over him, saying, Alas, my brother!

013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
        his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
        sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones
        beside his bones:

013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come
        to pass.

013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
        made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
        places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one
        of the priests of the high places.

013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
        cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
        disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
        Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the
        prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.

014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
        honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of
        the child.

014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
        came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his
        eyes were set by reason of his age.

014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
        cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when
        she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
        woman.

014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
        came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
        Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am
        sent to thee with heavy tidings.

014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made
        thee prince over my people Israel,

014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
        thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
        that only which was right in mine eyes;

014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
        hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
        provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
        Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
        against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
        and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a
        man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
        for the LORD hath spoken it.

014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
        thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
        found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the
        house of Jeroboam.

014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
        shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
        now.

014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
        water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
        which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond
        the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the
        LORD to anger.

014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
        died;

014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
        to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his
        servant Ahijah the prophet.

014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
        his stead.

014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
        forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
        choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
        And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
        him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.

014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree.

014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
        according to all the abominations of the nations which the
        LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
        the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and
        he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
        committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
        kept the door of the king's house.

014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
        that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
        chamber.

014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
        days.

014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah
        an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        reigned Abijam over Judah.

015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
        Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
        God, as the heart of David his father.

015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
        lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
        establish Jerusalem:

015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
        the Hittite.

015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.

015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
        Asa over Judah.

015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as
        did David his father.

015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
        all the idols that his fathers had made.

015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
        queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
        destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart
        was perfect with the LORD all his days.

015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
        and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of
        the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
        Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to
        Asa king of Judah.

015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
        servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
        Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
        Damascus, saying,

015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father
        and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
        silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
        Israel, that he may depart from me.

015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
        Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
        all the land of Naphtali.

015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left
        off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
        was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
        timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa
        built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
        that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
        Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
        feet.

015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his
        son reigned in his stead.

015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
        the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
        two years.

015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        laid siege to Gibbethon.

015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
        him, and reigned in his stead.

015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
        house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
        until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
        LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he
        made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
        LORD God of Israel to anger.

015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
        Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
        years.

015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,

016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
        prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way
        of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
        me to anger with their sins;

016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the
        posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house
        of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air
        eat.

016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
        might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
        and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
        came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his
        house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the
        LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in
        being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
        the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in
        the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
        and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his
        stead.

016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left
        him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his
        kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to
        the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu
        the prophet.

016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
        which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in
        provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
        conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
        made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day
        in the camp.

016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
        they besieged Tirzah.

016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died.

016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
        LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which
        he did, to make Israel to sin.

016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
        wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of
        the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
        and half followed Omri.

016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
        that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
        reigned.

016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in
        Tirzah.

016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
        silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,
        Samaria.

016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
        than all that were before him.

016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
        in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the
        LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel?

016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and
        Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of
        Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD
        above all that were before him.

016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
        to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took
        to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
        he had built in Samaria.

016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
        God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were
        before him.

016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
        foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
        gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word
        of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
        said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
        according to my word.

017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
        the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
        have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
        went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
        bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
        because there had been no rain in the land.

017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
        dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
        sustain thee.

017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
        gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
        of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
        thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
        Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
        but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
        cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go
        in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and
        die.

017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
        said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
        unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
        shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
        the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
        she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.

017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
        oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
        Elijah.

017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
        woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
        was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
        man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
        remembrance, and to slay my son?

017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of
        her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
        laid him upon his own bed.

017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
        also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
        slaying her son?

017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
        unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
        child's soul come into him again.

017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
        child came into him again, and he revived.

017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
        Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art
        a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
        truth.

018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
        came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
        unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a
        sore famine in Samaria.

018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
        (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
        that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
        fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
        find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose
        not all the beasts.

018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
        himself.

018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
        knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
        lord Elijah?

018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
        is here.

018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
        thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
        whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
        said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
        nation, that they found thee not.

018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here.

018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
        that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know
        not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
        thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from
        my youth.

018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
        prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's
        prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
        water?

018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here: and he shall slay me.

018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
        meet Elijah.

018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
        him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
        father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
        the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
        Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
        the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at
        Jezebel's table.

018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
        prophets together unto mount Carmel.

018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt
        ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but
        if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a
        word.

018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
        prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and
        fifty men.

018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
        one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
        on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other
        bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
        name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him
        be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
        spoken.

018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
        bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
        and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
        dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even
        until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,
        nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which
        was made.

018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
        said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
        is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he
        sleepeth, and must be awaked.

018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
        with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
        until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
        there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
        regarded.

018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
        all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
        of the LORD that was broken down.

018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
        tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
        came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
        and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
        contain two measures of seed.

018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
        and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
        water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
        time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
        third time.

018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
        trench also with water.

018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
        sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
        God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
        that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
        that I have done all these things at thy word.

018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
        art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
        again.

018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
        sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
        licked up the water that was in the trench.

018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
        they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
        one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
        them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
        there is a sound of abundance of rain.

018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
        top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
        put his face between his knees,

018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
        he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
        said, Go again seven times.

018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
        there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's
        hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,
        and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.

018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
        black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And
        Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
        loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how
        he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
        gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
        life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
        came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
        servant there.

019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
        came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
        himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
        LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.

019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
        angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
        coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
        drink, and laid him down again.

019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and
        touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
        too great for thee.

019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
        of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
        of God.

019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
        behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto
        him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
        thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
        sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
        take it away.

019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
        LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
        wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
        the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
        an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:

019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
        fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
        in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
        the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
        What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
        covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
        with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
        life, to take it away.

019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
        wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to
        be king over Syria:

019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
        Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
        thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
        Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword
        of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
        which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
        kissed him.

019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
        who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
        with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his
        mantle upon him.

019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,
        I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
        follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what
        have I done to thee?

019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
        slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
        oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he
        arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
        and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
        chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
        against it.

020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
        and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy
        children, even the goodliest, are mine.

020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
        according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
        Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
        shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
        thy children;

020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
        time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
        servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
        thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
        said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:
        for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for
        my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
        not unto him, nor consent.

020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
        lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
        the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the
        messengers departed, and brought him word again.

020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
        and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
        handfuls for all the people that follow me.

020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not
        him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
        putteth it off.

020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he
        was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
        unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set
        themselves in array against the city.

020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great
        multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
        and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
        by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
        said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
        provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
        them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
        Israel, being seven thousand.

020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
        drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two
        kings that helped him.

020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
        first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
        are men come out of Samaria.

020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
        alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
        the city, and the army which followed them.

020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
        Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on
        an horse with the horsemen.

020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
        chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
        Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
        at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
        against thee.

020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
        gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
        we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
        shall be stronger than they.

020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
        place, and put captains in their rooms:

020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
        horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
        against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger
        than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
        numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
        Israel.

020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
        present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
        pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
        Syrians filled the country.

020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
        Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians
        have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of
        the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude
        into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
        it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
        children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
        footmen in one day.

020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall
        fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.
        And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
        chamber.

020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
        the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I
        pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
        heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
        save thy life.

020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on
        their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
        servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
        Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would
        come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
        brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then
        Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into
        the chariot.

020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
        from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
        for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said
        Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
        covenant with him, and sent him away.

020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
        neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And
        the man refused to smite him.

020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice
        of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a
        lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
        a lion found him, and slew him.

020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
        And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
        and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
        said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
        behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and
        said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall
        thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of
        silver.

020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
        the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
        thyself hast decided it.

020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
        king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast
        let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
        destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
        people for his people.

020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
        and came to Samaria.

021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
        Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the
        palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
        I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
        my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
        it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
        it in money.

021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
        give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
        the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
        had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
        And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
        and would eat no bread.

021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
        thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
        Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
        or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard
        for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
        kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
        be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite.

021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
        seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
        that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
        Naboth on high among the people:

021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
        against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
        And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
        were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
        them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
        unto them.

021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
        people.

021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
        him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
        Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
        blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
        the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
        dead.

021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
        stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
        possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
        refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
        dead.

021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
        that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in
        Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
        is gone down to possess it.

021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
        Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt
        speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place
        where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
        blood, even thine.

021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
        he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
        to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
        posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
        the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
        of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
        the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
        made Israel to sin.

021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
        Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
        that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
        work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his
        wife stirred up.

021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
        all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
        his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
        lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
        humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
        days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
        house.

022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
        Israel.

022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
        king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
        Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
        of the hand of the king of Syria?

022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
        to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I
        am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
        horses.

022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
        LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
        me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
        hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
        each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
        in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
        prophesied before them.

022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and
        he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the
        Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the king's hand.

022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
        him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare
        good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
        be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.

022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
        me, that will I speak.

022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
        shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we
        forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
        shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name
        of the LORD?

022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
        sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
        no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
        the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
        and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and
        another said on that manner.

022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will persuade him.

022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
        forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
        prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail
        also: go forth, and do so.

022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        concerning thee.

022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD
        from me to speak unto thee?

022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
        thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I come in peace.

022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
        hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
        one of you.

022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
        And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
        battle.

022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
        that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with
        small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.
        And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
        cried out.

022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
        back from pursuing him.

022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
        unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up
        in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
        blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
        going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and
        every man to his own country.

022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
        the king in Samaria.

022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
        dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;
        according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
        ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in
        the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And
        his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
        aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for
        the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
        shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
        of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
        but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
        servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat
        would not.

022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his
        son reigned in his stead.

022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
        the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
        two years over Israel.

022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
        way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
        the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had
        done.

Book 12	2 Kings

001:001 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

001:002 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
        that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
        said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
        whether I shall recover of this disease.

001:003 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
        go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
        unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel,
        that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

001:004 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
        from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
        And Elijah departed.

001:005 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
        them, Why are ye now turned back?

001:006 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
        said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
        say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
        not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub
        the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
        bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:007 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up
        to meet you, and told you these words?

001:008 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
        girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
        the Tishbite.

001:009 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
        And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
        hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
        said, Come down.

001:010 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be
        a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
        thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and
        consumed him and his fifty.

001:011 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
        fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
        hath the king said, Come down quickly.

001:012 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God,
        let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
        fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
        him and his fifty.

001:013 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
        And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on
        his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
        O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
        fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

001:014 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
        captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
        let my life now be precious in thy sight.

001:015 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
        be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
        unto the king.

001:016 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou
        hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
        is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his
        word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
        thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:017 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
        spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
        Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
        no son.

001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

002:001 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into
        heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from
        Gilgal.

002:002 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the
        LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
        they went down to Bethel.

002:003 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
        know it; hold ye your peace.

002:004 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for
        the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
        liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
        came to Jericho.

002:005 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
        Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

002:006 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
        and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
        went on.

002:007 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
        view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

002:008 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
        the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
        they two went over on dry ground.

002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
        said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be
        taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
        double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

002:010 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
        thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto
        thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

002:011 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
        behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
        and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
        whirlwind into heaven.

002:012 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
        chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
        more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
        two pieces.

002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
        went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

002:014 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
        the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and
        when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
        thither: and Elisha went over.

002:015 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at
        Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
        Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
        ground before him.

002:016 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
        fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
        master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken
        him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
        And he said, Ye shall not send.

002:017 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
        They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
        found him not.

002:018 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
        he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

002:019 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
        the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but
        the water is naught, and the ground barren.

002:020 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
        they brought it to him.

002:021 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
        salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed
        these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
        barren land.

002:022 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
        saying of Elisha which he spake.

002:023 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
        by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
        and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
        up, thou bald head.

002:024 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
        name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of
        the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

002:025 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
        returned to Samaria.

003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
        Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
        reigned twelve years.

003:002 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
        father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal
        that his father had made.

003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

003:004 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
        the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred
        thousand rams, with the wool.

003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
        rebelled against the king of Israel.

003:006 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
        numbered all Israel.

003:007 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
        The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with
        me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as
        thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy
        horses.

003:008 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
        way through the wilderness of Edom.

003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
        king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
        journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
        cattle that followed them.

003:010 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
        these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
        Moab!

003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
        that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
        Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of
        Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.

003:012 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
        king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
        to him.

003:013 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
        with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
        prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
        Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to
        deliver them into the hand of Moab.

003:014 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
        Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee,
        nor see thee.

003:015 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
        minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

003:016 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
        ditches.

003:017 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall
        ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that
        ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

003:018 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
        will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

003:019 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
        and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
        and mar every good piece of land with stones.

003:020 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
        offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
        and the country was filled with water.

003:021 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
        fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
        armour, and upward, and stood in the border.

003:022 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon
        the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as
        red as blood:

003:023 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and
        they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
        spoil.

003:024 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
        up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but
        they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

003:025 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
        cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all
        the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
        Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
        went about it, and smote it.

003:026 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
        him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
        break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

003:027 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
        stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And
        there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
        from him, and returned to their own land.

004:001 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
        the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is
        dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and
        the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be
        bondmen.

004:002 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
        what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
        not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

004:003 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
        neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

004:004 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
        and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
        and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

004:005 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
        sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
        unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
        There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

004:007 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
        the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
        the rest.

004:008 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
        a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
        was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
        bread.

004:009 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
        this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

004:010 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
        let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
        a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
        shall turn in thither.

004:011 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
        the chamber, and lay there.

004:012 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
        when he had called her, she stood before him.

004:013 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
        careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
        thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the
        captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own
        people.

004:014 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
        answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

004:015 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
        in the door.

004:016 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
        thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
        of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

004:017 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
        Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

004:018 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
        out to his father to the reapers.

004:019 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to
        a lad, Carry him to his mother.

004:020 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
        sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

004:021 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
        and shut the door upon him, and went out.

004:022 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
        thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
        run to the man of God, and come again.

004:023 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is
        neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

004:024 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and
        go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

004:025 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And
        it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
        said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

004:026 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
        well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
        the child? And she answered, It is well:

004:027 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
        him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
        the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
        within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not
        told me.

004:028 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
        Do not deceive me?

004:029 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
        in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute
        him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
        my staff upon the face of the child.

004:030 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as
        thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
        followed her.

004:031 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
        face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
        Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
        child is not awaked.

004:032 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
        dead, and laid upon his bed.

004:033 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
        prayed unto the LORD.

004:034 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
        his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
        hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of
        the child waxed warm.

004:035 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
        up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
        seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
        called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
        up thy son.

004:037 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to
        the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

004:038 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
        land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
        and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
        pottage for the sons of the prophets.

004:039 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a
        wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and
        came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
        them not.

004:040 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
        they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and
        said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
        could not eat thereof.

004:041 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and
        he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there
        was no harm in the pot.

004:042 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
        God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and
        full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto
        the people, that they may eat.

004:043 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an
        hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
        eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
        thereof.

004:044 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
        according to the word of the LORD.

005:001 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
        great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
        LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
        man in valour, but he was a leper.

005:002 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
        away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
        waited on Naaman's wife.

005:003 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
        the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
        his leprosy.

005:004 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
        the maid that is of the land of Israel.

005:005 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
        letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
        him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold,
        and ten changes of raiment.

005:006 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
        when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
        sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
        of his leprosy.

005:007 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
        letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
        and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover
        a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
        how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

005:008 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
        king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
        saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
        to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

005:009 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
        at the door of the house of Elisha.

005:010 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
        Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
        and thou shalt be clean.

005:011 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
        thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
        the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
        place, and recover the leper.

005:012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
        the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So
        he turned and went away in a rage.

005:013 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
        father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
        wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
        saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

005:014 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
        according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
        again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

005:015 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
        came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
        that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

005:016 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
        receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

005:017 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
        to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant
        will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
        unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

005:018 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
        goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
        leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
        when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
        thy servant in this thing.

005:019 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
        little way.

005:020 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
        Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
        receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
        liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

005:021 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
        running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet
        him, and said, Is all well?

005:022 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
        Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
        young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,
        a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

005:023 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
        him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
        changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
        and they bare them before him.

005:024 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
        and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and
        they departed.

005:025 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
        unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
        went no whither.

005:026 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the
        man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
        to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
        vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        maidservants?

005:027 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
        unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
        leper as white as snow.

006:001 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
        place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

006:002 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
        man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may
        dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

006:003 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy
        servants. And he answered, I will go.

006:004 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
        down wood.

006:005 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the
        water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
        borrowed.

006:006 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
        place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and
        the iron did swim.

006:007 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his
        hand, and took it.

006:008 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
        with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
        my camp.

006:009 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,
        Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
        Syrians are come down.

006:010 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
        told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
        nor twice.

006:011 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
        this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
        Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?

006:012 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but
        Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of
        Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

006:013 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
        him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

006:014 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
        host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

006:015 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
        gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with
        horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
        master! how shall we do?

006:016 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
        than they that be with them.

006:017 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
        that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
        man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses
        and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

006:018 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
        and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
        he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

006:019 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
        this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
        ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
        Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
        see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and,
        behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

006:021 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
        father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

006:022 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou
        smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and
        with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
        eat and drink, and go to their master.

006:023 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
        eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
        master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
        Israel.

006:024 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
        gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

006:025 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
        besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces
        of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for
        five pieces of silver.

006:026 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
        cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

006:027 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
        thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

006:028 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may
        eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

006:029 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on
        the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath
        hid her son.

006:030 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
        woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the
        wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth
        within upon his flesh.

006:031 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
        Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

006:032 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
        the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
        came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a
        murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the
        messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
        door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

006:033 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
        down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD;
        what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

007:001 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the
        LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour
        be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
        in the gate of Samaria.

007:002 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
        God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
        heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
        see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

007:003 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
        gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we
        die?

007:004 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in
        the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
        die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
        the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
        kill us, we shall but die.

007:005 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
        Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
        camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

007:006 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
        of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
        host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
        hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings
        of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

007:007 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
        tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
        was, and fled for their life.

007:008 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
        they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
        thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
        came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
        also, and went and hid it.

007:009 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a
        day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
        the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
        therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

007:010 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
        told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
        behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
        horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

007:011 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's
        house within.

007:012 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
        will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
        that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
        hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
        the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

007:013 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I
        pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
        the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
        that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
        multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us
        send and see.

007:014 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
        after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

007:015 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
        full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
        in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
        king.

007:016 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
        So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
        measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
        LORD.

007:017 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
        have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake
        when the king came down to him.

007:018 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
        saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of
        fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
        the gate of Samaria:

007:019 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
        if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing
        be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
        but shalt not eat thereof.

007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died.

008:001 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
        life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
        sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath
        called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land
        seven years.

008:002 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
        God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
        land of the Philistines seven years.

008:003 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
        returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went
        forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.

008:004 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
        saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha
        hath done.

008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
        restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose
        son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house
        and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is
        the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

008:006 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
        appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
        was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
        she left the land, even until now.

008:007 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
        was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
        hither.

008:008 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
        and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him,
        saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

008:009 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
        of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and
        came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of
        Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this
        disease?

008:010 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
        certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he
        shall surely die.

008:011 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
        ashamed: and the man of God wept.

008:012 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
        I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
        their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
        wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
        and rip up their women with child.

008:013 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
        should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath
        shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

008:014 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
        to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
        that thou shouldest surely recover.

008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
        and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
        died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

008:016 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
        Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je
        hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

008:017 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
        reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

008:018 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
        house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he
        did evil in the sight of the LORD.

008:019 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
        sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
        children.

008:020 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
        made a king over themselves.

008:021 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
        he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
        about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
        into their tents.

008:022 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
        Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

008:023 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

008:024 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

008:025 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
        did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

008:026 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

008:027 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
        the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was
        the son in law of the house of Ahab.

008:028 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
        Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
        Joram.

008:029 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
        which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
        against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
        king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
        Jezreel, because he was sick.

009:001 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
        prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
        box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

009:002 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
        Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
        up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

009:003 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
        Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
        Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

009:004 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
        Ramothgilead.

009:005 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were
        sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
        Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O
        captain.

009:006 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
        on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,
        even over Israel.

009:007 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
        avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
        all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

009:008 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
        from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
        shut up and left in Israel:

009:009 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
        Ahijah:

009:010 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
        there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and
        fled.

009:011 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
        unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
        And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

009:012 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
        thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
        anointed thee king over Israel.

009:013 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
        under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
        saying, Jehu is king.

009:014 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
        against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all
        Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

009:015 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
        wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
        Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,
        then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to
        tell it in Jezreel.

009:016 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
        there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

009:017 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
        spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
        company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet
        them, and let him say, Is it peace?

009:018 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
        saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
        do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
        saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.

009:019 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
        and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
        What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

009:020 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
        cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
        the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

009:021 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
        And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
        each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
        him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
        peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
        whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so
        many?

009:023 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
        There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

009:024 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
        between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
        sunk down in his chariot.

009:025 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
        the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
        remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab
        his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

009:026 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
        blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
        this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
        into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

009:027 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
        way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
        said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the
        going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
        and died there.

009:028 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
        buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
        David.

009:029 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
        Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

009:030 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
        she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
        window.

009:031 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
        who slew his master?

009:032 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
        my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
        eunuchs.

009:033 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
        of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
        he trode her under foot.

009:034 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
        see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
        daughter.

009:035 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
        the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

009:036 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
        the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the
        Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
        flesh of Jezebel:

009:037 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
        the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not
        say, This is Jezebel.

010:001 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
        and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the
        elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

010:002 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's
        sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses,
        a fenced city also, and armour;

010:003 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
        set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
        house.

010:004 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
        stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

010:005 And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city,
        the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to
        Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
        shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
        good in thine eyes.

010:006 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
        be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
        heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel
        by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy
        persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought
        them up.

010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
        took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
        heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

010:008 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
        brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them
        in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

010:009 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
        stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
        conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
        these?

010:010 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
        word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of
        Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his
        servant Elijah.

010:011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
        Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
        priests, until he left him none remaining.

010:012 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was
        at the shearing house in the way,

010:013 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
        Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
        and we go down to salute the children of the king and the
        children of the queen.

010:014 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
        slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty
        men; neither left he any of them.

010:015 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
        son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
        to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
        And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.
        And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the
        chariot.

010:016 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So
        they made him ride in his chariot.

010:017 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
        Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
        saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

010:018 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
        Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

010:019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
        servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have
        a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting,
        he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
        that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

010:020 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
        proclaimed it.

010:021 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
        Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
        they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
        full from one end to another.

010:022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
        vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
        forth vestments.

010:023 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
        of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
        look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
        LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

010:024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
        Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the
        men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that
        letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
        the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
        captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
        smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
        captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
        Baal.

010:026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
        and burned them.

010:027 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
        house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

010:028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

010:029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
        Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the
        golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

010:030 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
        executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
        the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy
        children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
        Israel.

010:031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
        Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins
        of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

010:032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
        smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

010:033 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and
        the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by
        the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

010:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

010:035 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
        Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

010:036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was
        twenty and eight years.

011:001 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

011:002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
        took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
        king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and
        his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
        slain.

011:003 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
        And Athaliah did reign over the land.

011:004 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
        hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
        him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
        and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed
        them the king's son.

011:005 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
        do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
        even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

011:006 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
        at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
        the house, that it be not broken down.

011:007 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
        they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the
        king.

011:008 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
        weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
        him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
        he cometh in.

011:009 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
        that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man
        his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
        should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

011:010 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
        David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
        LORD.

011:011 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
        round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
        the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
        temple.

011:012 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
        him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
        anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
        the king.

011:013 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
        people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

011:014 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
        the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the
        king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
        trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason,
        Treason.

011:015 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
        hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have
        her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill
        with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain
        in the house of the LORD.

011:016 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
        which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
        slain.

011:017 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
        the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the
        king also and the people.

011:018 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
        and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in
        pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
        the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house
        of the LORD.

011:019 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
        the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
        down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way
        of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on
        the throne of the kings.

011:020 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
        quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's
        house.

011:021 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

012:001 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
        years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

012:002 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

012:003 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
        sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

012:004 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
        dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
        even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
        money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh
        into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

012:005 Let the priests take it to them, every man of his
        acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
        wheresoever any breach shall be found.

012:006 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
        Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the
        house.

012:007 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
        other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
        breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of
        your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the
        house.

012:008 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the
        people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

012:009 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
        lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
        one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that
        kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into
        the house of the LORD.

012:010 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
        chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and
        they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
        house of the LORD.

012:011 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
        that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
        LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
        that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

012:012 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
        hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
        and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

012:013 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
        silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
        vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD:

012:014 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
        house of the LORD.

012:015 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
        delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
        faithfully.

012:016 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
        house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

012:017 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
        and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

012:018 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
        Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
        Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
        gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
        and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
        and he went away from Jerusalem.

012:019 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

012:020 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash
        in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

012:021 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
        Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried
        him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
        reigned in his stead.

013:001 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
        king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
        Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

013:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
        followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
        Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

013:003 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
        the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

013:004 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto
        him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
        Syria oppressed them.

013:005 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
        from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
        dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

013:006 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
        Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there
        remained the grove also in Samaria.)

013:007 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
        horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
        king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
        dust by threshing.

013:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

013:009 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
        Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

013:010 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
        Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
        and reigned sixteen years.

013:011 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.

013:012 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
        his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

013:013 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
        throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of
        Israel.

013:014 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
        And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
        his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
        Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

013:015 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
        unto him bow and arrows.

013:016 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
        bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands
        upon the king's hands.

013:017 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
        Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the
        LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
        for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
        consumed them.

013:018 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said
        unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
        thrice, and stayed.

013:019 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
        shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
        smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou
        shalt smite Syria but thrice.

013:020 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
        Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
        they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
        sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
        touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
        feet.

013:022 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
        Jehoahaz.

013:023 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
        them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
        cast he them from his presence as yet.

013:024 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
        his stead.

013:025 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
        Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
        of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
        Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

014:001 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
        reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

014:002 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

014:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
        not like David his father: he did according to all things as
        Joash his father did.

014:004 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
        did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
        his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king
        his father.

014:006 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
        that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
        the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
        death for the children, nor the children be put to death for
        the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own
        sin.

014:007 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
        Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this
        day.

014:008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
        son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
        another in the face.

014:009 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

014:010 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
        thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest
        thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
        and Judah with thee?

014:011 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
        went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another
        in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

014:012 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
        every man to their tents.

014:013 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
        of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to
        Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate
        of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

014:014 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
        were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of
        the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

014:015 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
        might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they
        not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

014:016 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
        with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

014:017 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

014:018 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
        the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

014:019 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
        fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew
        him there.

014:020 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
        with his fathers in the city of David.

014:021 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
        years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

014:022 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

014:023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
        Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign
        in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

014:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel to sin.

014:025 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
        unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD
        God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant
        Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
        Gathhepher.

014:026 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
        bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
        helper for Israel.

014:027 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of
        Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
        Jeroboam the son of Joash.

014:028 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
        his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
        Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

014:029 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
        Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
        began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

015:002 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

015:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

015:004 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

015:005 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
        day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
        king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.

015:006 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:007 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
        his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned
        in his stead.

015:008 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
        Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
        months.

015:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:010 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
        him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:011 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:012 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu,
        saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
        fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

015:013 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
        thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
        month in Samaria.

015:014 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
        Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and
        slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:015 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
        he made, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:016 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
        coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him,
        therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were
        with child he ripped up.

015:017 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
        Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten
        years in Samaria.

015:018 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:019 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
        gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be
        with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

015:020 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the
        mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
        give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
        back, and stayed not there in the land.

015:021 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:022 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

015:023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
        of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
        two years.

015:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:025 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
        against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
        king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of
        the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

015:026 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:027 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
        the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
        reigned twenty years.

015:028 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:029 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king
        of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah,
        and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land
        of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

015:030 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
        son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
        his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

015:031 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:032 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
        began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

015:033 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
        he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

015:034 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
        did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

015:035 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
        built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

015:036 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:037 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
        king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

015:038 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son
        reigned in his stead.

016:001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
        son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

016:002 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
        sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
        in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

016:003 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
        his son to pass through the fire, according to the
        abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
        before the children of Israel.

016:004 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
        the hills, and under every green tree.

016:005 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
        Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz,
        but could not overcome him.

016:006 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
        drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
        dwelt there unto this day.

016:007 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
        saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
        of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the
        king of Israel, which rise up against me.

016:008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
        of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
        sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

016:009 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
        Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
        people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

016:010 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
        Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz
        sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
        pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.

016:011 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
        king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it
        against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

016:012 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
        altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered
        thereon.

016:013 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
        poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
        peace offerings, upon the altar.

016:014 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
        LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar
        and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
        altar.

016:015 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
        great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening
        meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat
        offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the
        land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
        sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all
        the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for
        me to enquire by.

016:016 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
        commanded.

016:017 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
        the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
        brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement
        of stones.

016:018 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
        house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house
        of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

016:019 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

016:020 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
        his stead.

017:001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
        of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

017:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but
        not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

017:003 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
        became his servant, and gave him presents.

017:004 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
        sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to
        the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
        the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

017:005 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
        went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

017:006 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
        and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
        and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
        Medes.

017:007 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
        the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
        of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        had feared other gods,

017:008 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
        out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
        Israel, which they had made.

017:009 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
        not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high
        places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to
        the fenced city.

017:010 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
        under every green tree:

017:011 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did
        the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and
        wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

017:012 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye
        shall not do this thing.

017:013 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
        all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
        your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
        according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
        which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
        like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
        LORD their God.

017:015 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
        with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
        against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
        went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning
        whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like
        them.

017:016 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
        made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
        and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

017:017 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
        the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
        themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
        to anger.

017:018 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
        them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
        Judah only.

017:019 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
        but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

017:020 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
        them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he
        had cast them out of his sight.

017:021 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
        following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

017:022 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
        which he did; they departed not from them;

017:023 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said
        by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
        out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

017:024 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
        Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
        and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
        children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
        the cities thereof.

017:025 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
        they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among
        them, which slew some of them.

017:026 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
        nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
        Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
        he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
        because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

017:027 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
        of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
        and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God
        of the land.

017:028 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
        Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they
        should fear the LORD.

017:029 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in
        the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
        every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

017:030 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
        made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

017:031 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
        burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
        the gods of Sepharvaim.

017:032 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the
        lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed
        for them in the houses of the high places.

017:033 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
        manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

017:034 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
        the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their
        ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
        commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

017:035 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them,
        saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to
        them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

017:036 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with
        great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
        him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

017:037 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
        commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
        for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

017:038 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
        forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

017:039 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
        out of the hand of all your enemies.

017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
        manner.

017:041 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
        images, both their children, and their children's children: as
        did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

018:001 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
        king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
        began to reign.

018:002 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
        he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's
        name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

018:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father did.

018:004 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
        the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
        had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn
        incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

018:005 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was
        none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were
        before him.

018:006 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
        but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

018:007 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
        went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
        served him not.

018:008 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
        thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
        was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
        that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
        besieged it.

018:010 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
        year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of
        Israel, Samaria was taken.

018:011 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
        and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and
        in the cities of the Medes:

018:012 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
        transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

018:013 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
        king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of
        Judah, and took them.

018:014 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
        Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which
        thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria
        appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of
        silver and thirty talents of gold.

018:015 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
        house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

018:016 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
        the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah
        king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
        Assyria.

018:017 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
        from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
        Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when
        they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the
        upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

018:018 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
        Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and
        Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

018:019 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

018:020 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
        strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou
        rebellest against me?

018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
        reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
        his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
        that trust on him.

018:022 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
        that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
        taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
        worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
        of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if
        thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

018:024 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

018:025 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to
        destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
        destroy it.

018:026 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
        unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the
        Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
        the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the
        wall.

018:027 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
        master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me
        to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
        dung, and drink their own piss with you?

018:028 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king,
        the king of Assyria:

018:029 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

018:030 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
        delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

018:031 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me,
        and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
        his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
        cistern:

018:032 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land
        of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
        hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
        LORD will deliver us.

018:033 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
        out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

018:034 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out
        of mine hand?

018:035 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
        delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

018:036 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
        for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

018:037 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

019:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

019:002 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
        sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

019:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are
        come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

019:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of
        Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to
        reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the
        LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
        remnant that are left.

019:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

019:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou
        hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
        have blasphemed me.

019:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him
        to fall by the sword in his own land.

019:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

019:009 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
        is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again
        unto Hezekiah, saying,

019:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
        shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

019:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be
        delivered?

019:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Thelasar?

019:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

019:014 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

019:015 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
        Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
        God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
        hast made heaven and earth.

019:016 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes,
        and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent
        him to reproach the living God.

019:017 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
        nations and their lands,

019:018 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

019:019 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us
        out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
        that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

019:020 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to
        me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

019:021 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
        virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed
        thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head
        at thee.

019:022 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

019:023 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast
        said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the
        height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
        down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees
        thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
        and into the forest of his Carmel.

019:024 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of
        my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

019:025 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of
        ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

019:026 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

019:027 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

019:028 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
        mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

019:029 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
        which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
        reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

019:030 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

019:031 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

019:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

019:033 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

019:034 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.

019:035 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD
        went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
        fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
        morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

019:036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
        And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
        Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

020:002 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
        saying,

020:003 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before
        thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
        which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
        court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

020:005 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
        saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
        prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
        the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

020:006 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
        thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and
        I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
        David's sake.

020:007 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
        it on the boil, and he recovered.

020:008 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
        LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
        the LORD the third day?

020:009 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
        the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
        shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

020:010 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
        go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward
        ten degrees.

020:011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
        shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
        dial of Ahaz.

020:012 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

020:013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the
        house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
        the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
        his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
        nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
        shewed them not.

020:014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from
        Babylon.

020:015 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All the things that are in mine house have they
        seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
        shewed them.

020:016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

020:017 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
        shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith
        the LORD.

020:018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

020:019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace
        and truth be in my days?

020:020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
        how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
        city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Judah?

020:021 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
        reigned in his stead.

021:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hephzibah.

021:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
        the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:003 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
        father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
        made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all
        the host of heaven, and served them.

021:004 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the
        LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

021:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

021:006 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
        and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
        wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
        to provoke him to anger.

021:007 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
        house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his
        son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out
        of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

021:008 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
        the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe
        to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
        according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

021:009 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
        evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the
        children of Israel.

021:010 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

021:011 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
        and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
        were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
        idols:

021:012 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am
        bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
        heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

021:013 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
        plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a
        man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

021:014 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
        become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

021:015 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
        have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
        forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

021:016 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
        filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
        wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of the LORD.

021:017 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
        his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:018 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
        son reigned in his stead.

021:019 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

021:020 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his father Manasseh did.

021:021 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
        served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

021:022 And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in
        the way of the LORD.

021:023 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
        king in his own house.

021:024 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

021:025 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:026 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
        Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

022:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

022:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
        aside to the right hand or to the left.

022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
        that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
        Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

022:004 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
        which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
        of the door have gathered of the people:

022:005 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
        work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
        let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the
        house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

022:006 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
        and hewn stone to repair the house.

022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
        that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
        faithfully.

022:008 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
        have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

022:009 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
        word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money
        that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
        hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
        house of the LORD.

022:010 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before
        the king.

022:011 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

022:012 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
        of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
        scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

022:013 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
        all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
        for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us,
        because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
        book, to do according unto all that which is written
        concerning us.

022:014 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
        and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
        Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
        wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and
        they communed with her.

022:015 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Tell the man that sent you to me,

022:016 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
        the book which the king of Judah hath read:

022:017 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
        against this place, and shall not be quenched.

022:018 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;

022:019 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
        before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this
        place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
        become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes,
        and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
        thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
        shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
        And they brought the king word again.

023:001 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
        of Judah and of Jerusalem.

023:002 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
        and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
        small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of
        the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
        LORD.

023:003 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
        LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and
        his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all
        their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
        written in this book. And all the people stood to the
        covenant.

023:004 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the
        priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
        bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
        were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of
        heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
        Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

023:005 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of
        Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
        cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them
        also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
        moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

023:006 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD,
        without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
        brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the
        powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

023:007 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by
        the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the
        grove.

023:008 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
        defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
        from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the
        gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the
        governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
        gate of the city.

023:009 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
        altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the
        unleavened bread among their brethren.

023:010 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
        of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to
        pass through the fire to Molech.

023:011 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
        to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by
        the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the
        suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

023:012 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
        Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
        Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
        did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
        cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

023:013 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
        the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
        king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of
        the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the
        Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of
        Ammon, did the king defile.

023:014 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
        and filled their places with the bones of men.

023:015 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
        which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
        made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and
        burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
        burned the grove.

023:016 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
        were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of
        the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted
        it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
        proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

023:017 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of
        the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God,
        which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou
        hast done against the altar of Bethel.

023:018 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
        let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came
        out of Samaria.

023:019 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
        cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to
        provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
        according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

023:020 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
        upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
        returned to Jerusalem.

023:021 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the
        passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book
        of this covenant.

023:022 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of
        the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
        kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

023:023 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this
        passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

023:024 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
        were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
        put away, that he might perform the words of the law which
        were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the
        house of the LORD.

023:025 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
        the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
        all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
        after him arose there any like him.

023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
        great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
        because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
        withal.

023:027 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
        as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city
        Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,
        My name shall be there.

023:028 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

023:029 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the
        king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
        against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

023:030 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
        and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
        sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
        Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's
        stead.

023:031 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

023:032 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

023:033 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
        Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land
        to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
        gold.

023:034 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
        room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
        and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

023:035 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
        taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment
        of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
        of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give
        it unto Pharaohnechoh.

023:036 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

023:037 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

024:001 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
        Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
        rebelled against him.

024:002 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
        of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
        children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
        servants the prophets.

024:003 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
        remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
        according to all that he did;

024:004 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
        Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not
        pardon.

024:005 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?

024:006 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
        reigned in his stead.

024:007 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
        for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto
        the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

024:008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
        was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

024:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father had done.

024:010 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
        came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
        his servants did besiege it.

024:012 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
        Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his
        princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in
        the eighth year of his reign.

024:013 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
        the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
        pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel
        had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

024:014 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
        all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and
        all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
        sort of the people of the land.

024:015 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
        mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty
        of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
        Babylon.

024:016 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
        and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war,
        even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

024:017 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
        king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

024:018 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

024:019 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

024:020 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
        and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

025:001 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
        tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host,
        against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built
        forts against it round about.

025:002 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
        Zedekiah.

025:003 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed
        in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the
        land.

025:004 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by
        night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by
        the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city
        round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.

025:005 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and
        overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
        scattered from him.

025:006 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of
        Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

025:007 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put
        out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass,
        and carried him to Babylon.

025:008 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which
        is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
        came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king
        of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

025:009 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and
        all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt
        he with fire.

025:010 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain
        of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

025:011 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
        fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the
        remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
        guard carry away.

025:012 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of
        the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

025:013 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
        and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
        LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass
        of them to Babylon.

025:014 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
        spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
        ministered, took they away.

025:015 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
        gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the
        guard took away.

025:016 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
        for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was
        without weight.

025:017 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
        chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter
        three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
        chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had
        the second pillar with wreathen work.

025:018 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
        door:

025:019 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the
        men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
        presence, which were found in the city, and the principal
        scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and
        threescore men of the people of the land that were found in
        the city:

025:020 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

025:021 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in
        the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their
        land.

025:022 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he
        made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

025:023 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
        heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
        there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
        Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son
        of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a
        Maachathite, they and their men.

025:024 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
        them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in
        the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well
        with you.

025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
        and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and
        the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

025:026 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
        the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of
        the Chaldees.

025:027 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
        captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
        the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

025:028 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the
        throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

025:029 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread
        continually before him all the days of his life.

025:030 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
        king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
        the son of Asiel,

004:036 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and
        Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
        Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:
        and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
        side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,
        and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of
        old.

004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
        Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
        found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
        dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for
        their flocks.

004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred
        men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,
        and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
        and dwelt there unto this day.

005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was
        the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
        his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of
        Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the
        birthright.

005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the
        chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,
        Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
        son,

005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried
        away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
        their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and
        Zechariah,

005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
        who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
        wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
        multiplied in the land of Gilead.

005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who
        fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
        all the east land of Gilead.

005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
        of Bashan unto Salcah:

005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
        in Bashan.

005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,
        Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
        Zia, and Heber, seven.

005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
        Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
        Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of
        their fathers.

005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
        all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
        king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
        Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,
        and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty
        thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the
        war.

005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
        and Nodab.

005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
        delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for
        they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
        because they put their trust in him.

005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
        thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
        asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.
        And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
        land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,
        and unto mount Hermon.

005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
        Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
        Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and
        heads of the house of their fathers.

005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
        went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom
        God destroyed before them.

005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
        Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
        and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto
        Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this
        day.

006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.

006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The

006:010 And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the
        priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in
        Jerusalem:)

006:011 And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,

006:012 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum,

006:013 And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,

006:014 And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,

006:015 And Jehozadak went into captivity, when the LORD carried away
        Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.

006:016 The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.

006:017 And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and

006:032 And they ministered before the dwelling place of the
        tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had
        built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem: and then they waited
        on their office according to their order.

006:055 And they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the

        came to comfort him.

007:023 And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a
        son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with

        inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of
        Gath:

008:014 And Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,

008:015 And Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,

008:016 And Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah;

008:017 And Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki, and Heber,

008:018 Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal;

008:019 And Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,

008:020 And Elienai, and Zilthai, and Eliel,

008:021 And Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimhi;

008:022 And Ishpan, and Heber, and Eliel,

008:023 And Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,

008:024 And Hananiah, and Elam, and Antothijah,

008:025 And Iphedeiah, and Penuel, the sons of Shashak;

008:026 And Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and Athaliah,

008:027 And Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham.

008:028 These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief
        men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.

008:029 And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife's name
        was Maachah:

008:030 And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
        Nadab,

008:031 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.

008:032 And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And these also dwelt with their
        brethren in Jerusalem, over against them.

008:033 And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat
        Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

008:034 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat
        Micah.

008:035 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and
        Ahaz.

008:036 And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and
        Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,

008:037 And Moza begat Binea: Rapha was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel
        his son:

008:038 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
        Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan.
        All these were the sons of Azel.

008:039 And the sons of Eshek his brother were, Ulam his firstborn,
        Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

008:040 And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and
        had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. All these
        are of the sons of Benjamin.

009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
        were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who
        were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

009:002 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in
        their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and
        the Nethinims.

009:003 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the
        children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and
        Manasseh;

009:004 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri,
        the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.

009:005 And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.

009:006 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six
        hundred and ninety.

009:007 And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the
        son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,

009:008 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the
        son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son
        of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

009:009 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine
        hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the
        fathers in the house of their fathers.

009:010 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

009:011 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son
        of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of
        the house of God;

009:012 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
        Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,
        the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
        Immer;

009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
        thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for
        the work of the service of the house of God.

009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
        Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
        Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
        that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
        Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were
        porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
        Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
        Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
        gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the
        host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
        time past, and the LORD was with him.

009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were
        two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy
        in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
        in their set office.

009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of
        the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by
        wards.

009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
        north, and south.

009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
        after seven days from time to time with them.

009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
        office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house
        of God.

009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
        charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
        pertained to them.

009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
        that they should bring them in and out by tale.

009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
        all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
        the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
        spices.

009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
        Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that
        were made in the pans.

009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
        were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the
        Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they
        were employed in that work day and night.

009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
        generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's
        name was Maachah:

009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
        Ner, and Nadab.

009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
        brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
        Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
        Micah.

009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
        and Ahaz.

009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
        and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
        Azel his son.

009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
        Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
        these were the sons of Azel.

010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his
        sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him, and he was wounded of the archers.

010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
        me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse
        me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
        Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise on the sword, and died.

010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
        together.

010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw
        that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then
        they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
        in mount Gilboa.

010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
        armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
        to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and
        fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
        done to Saul,

010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of
        Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
        and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
        seven days.

010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
        the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept
        not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar
        spirit, to enquire of it;

010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
        turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
        saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast
        he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy
        God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou
        shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
        and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
        and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
        word of the LORD by Samuel.

011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;
        where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not
        come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
        is the city of David.

011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
        chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
        and was chief.

011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the
        city of David.

011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round
        about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was
        with him.

011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
        strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
        Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD
        concerning Israel.

011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
        Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted
        up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
        was one of the three mighties.

011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
        gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full
        of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and
        delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
        them by a great deliverance.

011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
        David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
        Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison
        was then at Bethlehem.

011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and
        drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
        and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
        drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.

011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:
        shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
        in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought
        it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
        three mightiest.

011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:
        for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,
        and had a name among the three.

011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
        their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy
        day.

011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
        high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's
        beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
        spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
        spear.

011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among the three mighties.

011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not
        to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of
        Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the
        Netophathite,

011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the
        children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
        Hararite,

011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
        Reubenites, and thirty with him,

011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan
        the Aroerite,

011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
        Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
        kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
        were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
        and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a
        bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
        Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
        Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
        over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
        Josabad the Gederathite,

012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
        Shephatiah the Haruphite,

012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
        the Korhites,

012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
        the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit
        for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
        faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the
        roes upon the mountains;

012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
        the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
        thousand.

012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
        it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
        them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the
        west.

012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
        hold unto David.

012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
        them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
        shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine
        enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of
        our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
        captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,
        thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
        thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
        them, and made them captains of the band.

012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with
        the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
        not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
        away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
        of our heads.

012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
        and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
        and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
        were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
        until it was a great host, like the host of God.

012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed
        to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
        of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
        thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
        seven thousand and one hundred.

012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
        were three thousand and seven hundred;

012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
        house twenty and two captains.

012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
        thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
        ward of the house of Saul.

012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
        hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
        their fathers.

012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
        were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
        understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
        the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren
        were at their commandment.

012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
        all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
        they were not of double heart.

012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
        and spear thirty and seven thousand.

012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
        six hundred.

012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
        forty thousand.

012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
        instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty
        thousand.

012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
        perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:
        and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make
        David king.

012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and
        drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
        Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
        and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
        bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
        abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
        hundreds, and with every leader.

013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
        good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send
        abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the
        land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites
        which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather
        themselves unto us:

013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
        enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
        thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
        even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
        Kirjathjearim.

013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
        Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the
        ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,
        whose name is called on it.

013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house
        of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their
        might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,
        and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
        forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he
        smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
        died before God.

013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this
        day.

013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
        bring the ark of God home to me?

013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of
        David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
        Gittite.

013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
        house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of
        Obededom, and all that he had.

014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
        cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
        Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
        people Israel.

014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
        sons and daughters.

014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
        Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
        over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.
        And David heard of it, and went out against them.

014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
        Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And
        the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
        thine hand.

014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.
        Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
        hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called
        the name of that place Baalperazim.

014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
        commandment, and they were burned with fire.

014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
        valley.

014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,
        Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to
        battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
        the Philistines.

014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
        host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
        brought the fear of him upon all nations.

015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
        place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
        Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of
        God, and to minister unto him for ever.

015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
        up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared
        for it.

015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
        hundred and twenty:

015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
        hundred and twenty:

015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an
        hundred and thirty:

015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
        two hundred:

015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
        fourscore:

015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
        an hundred and twelve.

015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
        the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
        and Amminadab,

015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
        Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that
        ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the
        place that I have prepared for it.

015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made
        a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
        order.

015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
        up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
        shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
        according to the word of the LORD.

015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
        brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,
        psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
        voice with joy.

015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
        brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
        Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
        Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
        Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
        Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to
        sound with cymbals of brass;

015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
        Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
        Alamoth;

015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
        Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he
        instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
        Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
        with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and
        Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
        thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven
        bullocks and seven rams.

015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
        Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
        master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him
        an ephod of linen.

015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
        trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
        harps.

015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul
        looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
        and she despised him in her heart.

016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
        tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
        sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of
        the LORD.

016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
        every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
        flagon of wine.

016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
        ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the
        LORD God of Israel:

016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
        Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
        Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
        harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
        continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
        LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
        deeds among the people.

016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
        chosen ones.

016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations;

016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his
        oath unto Isaac;

016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,

016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance;

016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
        to another people;

016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,

016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
        his salvation.

016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
        among all nations.

016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is
        to be feared above all gods.

016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness
        are in his place.

016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty
        of holiness.

016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
        stable, that it be not moved.

016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
        men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
        rejoice, and all that is therein.

016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
        the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
        together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
        thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
        the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
        continually, as every day's work required:

016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
        Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
        tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the
        burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do
        according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
        he commanded Israel;

016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
        chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the
        LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for
        those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
        of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
        returned to bless his house.

017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
        said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
        but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
        curtains.

017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;
        for God is with thee.

017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
        to Nathan, saying,

017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
        not build me an house to dwell in:

017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought
        up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
        from one tabernacle to another.

017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
        any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
        people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even
        from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
        people Israel:

017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
        have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
        thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
        earth.

017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
        moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
        them any more, as at the beginning,

017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
        Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an
        house.

017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
        must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
        after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
        his kingdom.

017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
        ever.

017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
        take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
        before thee:

017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
        ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
        am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
        hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to
        come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
        high degree, O LORD God.

017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
        servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
        heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
        these great things.

017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
        beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
        ears.

017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a
        name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
        from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
        ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
        concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
        for ever, and do as thou hast said.

017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
        ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a
        God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
        established before thee.

017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
        him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to
        pray before thee.

017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
        unto thy servant:

017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou
        blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
        and brought gifts.

018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
        went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
        thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
        houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an
        hundred chariots.

018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
        of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
        men.

018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians
        became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
        brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the
        brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
        the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
        welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
        against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
        with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and
        silver and brass.

018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
        and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from
        Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from
        the Philistines, and from Amalek.

018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
        the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
        David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
        he went.

018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
        justice among all his people.

018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, recorder.

018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
        the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the
        king.

019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
        children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
        sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
        servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon
        to Hanun, to comfort him.

019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
        Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
        sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
        for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
        cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
        and sent them away.

019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were
        served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
        ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
        be grown, and then return.

019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
        themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
        sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
        horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out
        of Zobah.

019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
        of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
        And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
        their cities, and came to battle.

019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
        come were by themselves in the field.

019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
        and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
        them in array against the Syrians.

019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
        Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against
        the children of Ammon.

019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will help thee.

019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
        our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do
        that which is good in his sight.

019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
        Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
        into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
        before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
        Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain
        of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
        over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array
        against them. So when David had put the battle in array
        against the Syrians, they fought with him.

019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
        Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty
        thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
        the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and
        became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
        children of Ammon any more.

020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
        time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of
        the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
        came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
        Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
        found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious
        stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
        also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them
        with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
        dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
        with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
        were subdued.

020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the
        son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
        whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on
        each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the
        giant.

020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
        brother slew him.

020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
        number Israel.

021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
        number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number
        of them to me, that I may know it.

021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times
        so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not
        all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this
        thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
        Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
        Jerusalem.

021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
        And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
        thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred
        threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
        king's word was abominable to Joab.

021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
        Israel.

021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
        done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity
        of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
        three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto
        thee.

021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
        Choose thee

021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
        before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies
        overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,
        even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
        destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore
        advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent
        me.

021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:
        but let me not fall into the hand of man.

021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
        Israel seventy thousand men.

021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
        was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the
        evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
        now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
        stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
        in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
        elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
        their faces.

021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
        to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
        indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's
        house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
        David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
        name of the LORD.

021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
        with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
        went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David
        with his face to the ground.

021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
        threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the
        LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the
        plague may be stayed from the people.

021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
        the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee
        the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
        instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
        give it all.

021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
        for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine
        for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
        gold by weight.

021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
        and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
        burnt offering.

021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
        again into the sheath thereof.

021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
        the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
        there.

021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
        wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that
        season in the high place at Gibeon.

021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
        afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this
        is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were
        in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones
        to build the house of God.

022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
        doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
        abundance without weight;

022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
        Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the
        house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding
        magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
        will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared
        abundantly before his death.

022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
        an house for the LORD God of Israel.

022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
        mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
        blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not
        build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
        upon the earth in my sight.

022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
        rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
        about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
        and quietness unto Israel in his days.

022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,
        and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
        his kingdom over Israel for ever.

022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and
        build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
        thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law
        of the LORD thy God.

022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
        statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with
        concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
        nor be dismayed.

022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
        the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
        thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
        weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I
        prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
        workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for
        every manner of work.

022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
        no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with
        thee.

022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
        his son, saying,

022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you
        rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
        land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,
        and before his people.

022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
        arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
        to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
        vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
        of the LORD.

023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
        son king over Israel.

023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
        priests and the Levites.

023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
        upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
        thirty and eight thousand.

023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the
        work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers
        and judges:

023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
        the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to
        praise therewith.

023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
        namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and
        Joel, three.

023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
        These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
        Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
        Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
        reckoning, according to their father's house.

023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
        that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons
        for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto
        him, and to bless in his name for ever.

023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
        the tribe of Levi.

023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
        had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
        Eleazar, and Kish.

023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
        brethren the sons of Kish took them.

023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
        even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number
        of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of
        the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
        upward.

023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto
        his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the
        tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
        twenty years old and above:

023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
        service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
        chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
        work of the service of the house of God;

023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
        offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is
        baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
        manner of measure and size;

023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
        likewise at even:

023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
        sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
        according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
        the LORD:

023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge
        of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
        house of the LORD.

024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
        Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
        children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
        office.

024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
        and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
        offices in their service.

024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
        than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among
        the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house
        of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar
        according to the house of their fathers.

024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
        governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,
        were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the
        Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and
        Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
        before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
        one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
        for Ithamar.

024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to
        Jedaiah,

024:008 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

024:009 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

024:010 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

024:011 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

024:012 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

024:013 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

024:014 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

024:015 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

024:016 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

024:017 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to
        Gamul,

024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
        Maaziah.

024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
        the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron
        their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

024:020 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of
        Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

024:021 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was
        Isshiah.

024:022 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

024:023 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

024:024 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
        Zechariah.

024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
        Beno.

024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
        and Ibri.

024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
        were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons
        of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
        Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
        Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
        brethren.

025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
        service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
        who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
        cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their
        service was:

025:002 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
        Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which
        prophesied according to the order of the king.

025:003 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
        Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
        their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
        thanks and to praise the LORD.

025:004 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel,
        Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
        and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
        Mahazioth:

025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
        of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen
        sons and three daughters.

025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
        house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
        the service of the house of God, according to the king's order
        to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were
        instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were
        cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as
        the great, the teacher as the scholar.

025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second
        to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

025:010 The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

        twelve:

025:016 The ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:017 The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:018 The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:019 The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:020 The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:021 The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:022 The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:023 The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:024 The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:025 The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:026 The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:027 The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:028 The one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:029 The two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:030 The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:031 The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve.

026:001 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
        Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

026:002 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn,
        Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

026:004 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,
        Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
        and Nethaneel the fifth.

026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth:
        for God blessed him.

026:006 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled
        throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men
        of valour.

026:007 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
        whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

026:008 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and
        their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were
        threescore and two of Obededom.

026:009 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the
        chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
        made him the chief;)

026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
        all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

026:012 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the
        chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in
        the house of the LORD.

026:013 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according
        to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

026:014 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
        son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
        northward.

026:015 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the
        gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward
        against ward.

026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward
        four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

026:018 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

026:019 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
        and among the sons of Merari.

026:020 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
        of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

026:021 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
        Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were
        Jehieli.

026:022 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were
        over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

026:023 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
        Uzzielites:

026:024 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of
        the treasures.

026:025 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah
        his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith
        his son.

026:026 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures
        of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief
        fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
        captains of the host, had dedicated.

026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
        the house of the LORD.

026:028 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
        Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
        dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under
        the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
        business over Israel, for officers and judges.

026:030 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
        valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them
        of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of
        the LORD, and in the service of the king.

026:031 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
        Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
        the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
        and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer
        of Gilead.

026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
        hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the
        Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for
        every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
        chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and
        their officers that served the king in any matter of the
        courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout
        all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the
        son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
        thousand.

027:003 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of
        the host for the first month.

027:004 And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite,
        and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course
        likewise were twenty and four thousand.

027:005 The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were
        twenty and four thousand.

027:006 This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and
        above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

027:007 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother
        of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course
        were twenty and four thousand.

027:008 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the
        Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

027:009 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of
        Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four
        thousand.

027:010 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the
        Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were
        twenty and four thousand.

027:011 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the
        Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:012 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
        Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty
        and four thousand.

027:013 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the
        Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty
        and four thousand.

027:014 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
        Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course
        were twenty and four thousand.

027:015 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
        Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
        Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
        Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

027:017 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
        Zadok:

027:018 Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar,
        Omri the son of Michael:

027:019 Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth
        the son of Azriel:

027:020 Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the
        half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

027:021 Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of
        Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of
        the tribes of Israel.

027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
        and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel
        like to the stars of the heavens.

027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
        because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
        the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
        and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in
        the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of
        Uzziah:

027:026 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
        the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the
        increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the
        Shiphmite:

027:028 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in
        the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the
        cellars of oil was Joash:

027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the
        Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was
        Shaphat the son of Adlai:

027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
        asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

027:031 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
        rulers of the substance which was king David's.

027:032 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and
        a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's
        sons:

027:033 And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the
        Archite was the king's companion:

027:034 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
        Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.

028:001 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
        the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered
        to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands,
        and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
        substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with
        the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the
        valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

028:002 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
        my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to
        build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
        the building:

028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my
        name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
        blood.

028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house
        of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath
        chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
        house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
        me to make me king over all Israel:

028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
        hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
        kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
        and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will
        be his father.

028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
        constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
        day.

028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
        the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
        all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
        this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
        children after you for ever.

028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
        serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
        the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
        imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be
        found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
        for ever.

028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
        for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
        and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and
        of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
        thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
        courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round
        about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
        treasuries of the dedicated things:

028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
        all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for
        all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
        instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
        instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
        kind of service:

028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
        lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the
        lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,
        both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,
        according to the use of every candlestick.

028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
        every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
        cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for
        every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of
        silver:

028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
        for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
        out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD.

028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing
        by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
        courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD
        God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,
        nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
        the service of the house of the LORD.

028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
        they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of
        God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of
        workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of
        service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at
        thy commandment.

029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
        Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
        tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
        but for the LORD God.

029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
        the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for
        things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
        for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,
        and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers
        colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
        in abundance.

029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
        God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which
        I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
        have prepared for the holy house.

029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
        seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls
        of the houses withal:

029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
        silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
        artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service
        this day unto the LORD?

029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
        Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
        rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,

029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
        thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
        thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and
        one hundred thousand talents of iron.

029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
        treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
        Gershonite.

029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
        because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
        and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
        and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our
        father, for ever and ever.

029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
        and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
        heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
        LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
        all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
        it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
        name.

029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
        offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
        thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
        our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
        is none abiding.

029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
        thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
        all thine own.

029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
        pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
        heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have
        I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
        willingly unto thee.

029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
        this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
        of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
        commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
        these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have
        made provision.

029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD
        your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of
        their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the
        LORD, and the king.

029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
        even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
        lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
        for all Israel:

029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
        gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the
        second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief
        governor, and Zadok to be priest.

029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
        David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
        likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
        king.

029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
        Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not
        been on any king before him in Israel.

029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
        honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
        are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
        Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
        him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
        countries.

Book 14	2 Chronicles

001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
        and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
        exceedingly.

001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
        thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
        governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
        high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
        the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
        had made in the wilderness.

001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
        the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
        a tent for it at Jerusalem.

001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
        son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
        LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
        LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
        Ask what I shall give thee.

001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
        David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
        established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
        dust of the earth in multitude.

001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
        in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
        is so great?

001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
        thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
        thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
        asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
        my people, over whom I have made thee king:

001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
        thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
        have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
        after thee have the like.

001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
        at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and reigned over Israel.

001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
        thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
        king at Jerusalem.

001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
        stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
        in the vale for abundance.

001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
        for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
        and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
        the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
        LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
        burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
        three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
        didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
        build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
        dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
        for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
        morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
        ordinance for ever to Israel.

002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
        above all gods.

002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
        should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
        him?

002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
        silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
        and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
        that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
        father did provide.

002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
        Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
        in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
        servants,

002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
        am about to build shall be wonderful great.

002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
        timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
        thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
        wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
        to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
        made thee king over them.

002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
        made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
        son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
        an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
        of Huram my father's,

002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
        a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
        brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
        and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
        graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
        him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
        David thy father.

002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
        wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
        servants:

002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
        need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
        and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
        of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
        numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
        thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
        of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
        mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
        the people a work.

003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
        in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
        father, in the place that David had prepared in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
        in the fourth year of his reign.

003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
        the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
        the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
        twenty cubits.

003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
        of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
        cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
        overlaid it within with pure gold.

003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
        overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
        chains.

003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
        and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
        walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
        cherubims on the walls.

003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
        according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
        gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
        overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
        work, and overlaid them with gold.

003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
        wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
        of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
        reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
        the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
        also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
        cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
        inward.

003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
        fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
        cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
        them was five cubits.

003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
        heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
        put them on the chains.

003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
        right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
        that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
        left Boaz.

004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
        thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
        the height thereof.

004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
        line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
        round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
        Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
        like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
        and it received and held three thousand baths.

004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
        five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
        for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
        for the priests to wash in.

004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
        and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
        on the left.

004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
        on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
        hundred basons of gold.

004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
        court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
        with brass.

004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
        against the south.

004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
        Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
        for the house of God;

004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
        which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
        to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
        top of the pillars;

004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
        pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
        chapiters which were upon the pillars.

004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
        their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
        for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
        the weight of the brass could not be found out.

004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
        God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
        shewbread was set;

004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
        burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
        gold, and that perfect gold;

004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
        censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
        doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
        house of the temple, were of gold.

005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
        was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
        his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
        all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
        of God.

005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
        the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
        king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
        ark.

005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
        were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
        oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
        the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
        staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
        not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
        put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
        children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
        sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
        of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
        being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
        and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
        an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
        one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
        the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
        trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
        the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
        ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
        house of the LORD;

005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
        God.

006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
        the thick darkness.

006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
        for thy dwelling for ever.

006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
        congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
        stood.

006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
        his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
        father David, saying,

006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
        of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
        I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
        have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
        thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
        that it was in thine heart:

006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
        which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
        house for my name.

006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
        spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
        am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
        built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
        LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
        all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
        and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
        in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
        down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
        spread forth his hands toward heaven.

006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
        the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
        shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
        all their hearts:

006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
        which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
        hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
        David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
        throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
        way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
        which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
        less this house which I have built!

006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
        upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
        thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
        prayeth toward this place.

006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
        of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
        hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
        thou hearest, forgive.

006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
        him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
        this house;

006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
        requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
        head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
        to his righteousness.

006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
        confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
        in this house;

006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
        people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
        gavest to them and to their fathers.

006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
        and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
        afflict them;

006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
        servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
        the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
        land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
        inheritance.

006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
        there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
        their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
        whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
        any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
        know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
        his hands in this house:

006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
        and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
        heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
        children of men:)

006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
        live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
        Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
        sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
        come and pray in this house;

006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
        that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
        as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
        I have built is called by thy name.

006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
        that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
        city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
        for thy name;

006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
        supplication, and maintain their cause.

006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
        before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
        land far off or near;

006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
        carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
        their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
        and have dealt wickedly;

006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
        them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
        unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
        chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
        cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
        thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
        place.

006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
        and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
        clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
        goodness.

006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
        the mercies of David thy servant.

007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
        down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
        sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
        because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
        down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
        themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
        and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
        for his mercy endureth for ever.

007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
        LORD.

007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
        thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
        the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
        instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
        made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
        when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
        trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
        before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
        brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
        the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
        all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
        entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
        kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
        seven days.

007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
        sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
        for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
        Solomon, and to Israel his people.

007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
        house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
        house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
        effected.

007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
        I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
        for an house of sacrifice.

007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
        locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
        people;

007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
        themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
        wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
        their sin, and will heal their land.

007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
        prayer that is made in this place.

007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
        may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
        there perpetually.

007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
        father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
        thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
        have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
        commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
        serve other gods, and worship them;

007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
        have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
        my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
        proverb and a byword among all nations.

007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
        every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
        the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
        their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
        Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
        served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
        them.

008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
        Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
        built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
        cities, which he built in Hamath.

008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
        fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
        all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
        all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
        Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
        make to pay tribute until this day.

008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
        his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
        and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
        hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
        of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
        said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
        Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
        LORD hath come.

008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
        altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
        commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
        feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
        the feast of tabernacles.

008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
        the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
        to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
        as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
        courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
        commanded.

008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
        the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
        the treasures.

008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
        foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
        finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
        in the land of Edom.

008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
        servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
        servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
        fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
        came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
        very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
        abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
        Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
        hid from Solomon which he told her not.

009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,

009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
        cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
        went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
        in her.

009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
        in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
        eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
        of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
        that I heard.

009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
        stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
        thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
        thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
        made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
        was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
        Solomon.

009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
        which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
        precious stones.

009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
        the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
        for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
        of Judah.

009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
        the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
        and her servants.

009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
        kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
        silver to Solomon.

009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
        hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
        them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with pure gold.

009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
        gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
        side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
        stays:

009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
        all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
        pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
        of in the days of Solomon.

009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
        Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
        and wisdom.

009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
        to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
        mules, a rate year by year.

009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
        cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
        land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
        trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
        in abundance.

009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
        all lands.

009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
        not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
        prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
        the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
        city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
        come to make him king.

010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
        king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
        and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
        somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
        yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
        And the people departed.

010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
        counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
        people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
        will be thy servants for ever.

010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
        took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
        that stood before him.

010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
        answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
        somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
        him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
        little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
        more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
        will chastise you with scorpions.

010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
        day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
        day.

010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
        the counsel of the old men,

010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
        father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
        scorpions.

010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
        of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
        by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat.

010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
        them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
        we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
        thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
        the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
        But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
        flee to Jerusalem.

010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
        house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
        chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
        he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
        saying,

011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
        all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
        is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
        returned from going against Jeroboam.

011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
        in Judah.

011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
        Benjamin fenced cities.

011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
        and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
        them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
        resorted to him out of all their coasts.

011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
        came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
        cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
        LORD:

011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
        devils, and for the calves which he had made.

011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
        their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
        to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
        walked in the way of David and Solomon.

011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
